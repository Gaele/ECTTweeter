(JPN,medium) Many people think waht the successful measn is in the life . Someone think that successful people try to new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already how to do well . Something is true , but many people do not agree this idea . This is the examples that many people think disagree . People need to think about the person who take a risk in the business . The person take a risky action for promotintg the company . He might take a risk illegally . This is not good for people if he take a risk as illegal person because many companies have shareholders , emploees , and employee 's familes . The leaders must consider carefully because many people have trust for the one person who judge . Many people think the successful people try new things and take a risk is not realistic story . This means many companies leader do n't take a risk In fact , after many leaders think carefully , statistically , analstically , they decide to donduct the companies power or budget . Many things that many people seemed a risky action is not risky action for the person . They have a prosperity or expectancy that the person can win in the business . For example , the Microsoft change the and successful the world , but the founder already had the prospect for the future that the computer will chgange the wotrld definitely . For example , the Yutube owner changed medai world , but they also knew the future the Yutube change the world , so many people do n't do risky action when they do n't think to win . Many people think successful people try to new things is cool , but many company leaders considered very carefully , analistically . MNany leaders do n't do new thing the new project definitely turned to red budget . In fact , The successful people is very few compared to the rate of the human population on the whole entire world . Many leaders think carefully or rational befire they take action .
(JPN,medium) Because I am not an old person yet , also I do n't live with my granparents and I do n't have close person who is old , so I just can imagine how old people 's life will be . Or I could get informations from watching TV or reading books . To enjoy life , I think it should be only one thing to do . Have friends ! This is the most important thing people should do when they want to enjoy their lives . This dose n't matter either the person is young or old . So I disagree with the sentence . Having a conversation with friends will make my life much more enjoyable . I always feel that ` friends ' are my treasure . In other words , friends will be the key to enjoy life . When I be alone by myself , I need to enjoy just by myself which is very hard to do . If I am with my friends , I could laugh saying joke or having girls talk . Also , I could reduse stress having a conversation or complaining about the problems I have . Having less stress in life will make our life enjoyable , as well . Therefore , I think we should have at least a little stress in our life to spend time more valuable . When we do n't have stress at all , we ca n't understand the people who had stress or we will waste time for not having a stress . But when we have to much stress , we ca n't focus on the things we should do or need to do . Having a good meal will also make our life better . When people get hungery , especially me , we will get angry and wo n't have enough space in our feelings to enjoy something . For having a happy life , our stomache should be happy like us . Having a hobby is important like others . I love to play soccer and I 've been playing for more than ten years-including few year when I did n't . This hobby makes me very happy and satisfied with the life I have . The most important thing of having a hobby is that we could be coneccted with others who has a same interest . I had many friends from the same soccer team , which makes my life enjoyable because of the first reason . Maybe when I get old , it might be impossible to play soccer , but still I can talk about soccer with my friends ! There is no reason that old people wo n't have an enjoyable life like youngers . We could have same great life if we try to enjoy ourselves . I think the people who are not enjoying their lives are not trying to enjoy . I am enjoying my life-following the reason I think I should do to
(HIN,high) It is commonly said that , even if you get old remain young at heart . This is because young enjoys every bit of life , when they are working , playing , partying or even when they are wasting their time . Youth represents eneregy , flow , ability to work hard and party harder . Therefore , I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . At young age , people have dreams , aims , hopes and ability to fulfill their dream . This encourage them continously to work hard and acheive their goal . At young age , they enjoy this hard work . while older people do it for its sake . For them , it is routine and nothing inspiring is left in doing those thing . They are just cutting the time . At the time of party , youth enjoys it even harder , as it is the outcome of their hard work . They tend to flirt , dance , drive , eat and drink . This gives them an complete experience , which the old can never enjoy . Being old , you cannot flirt or dance , and limitations come on eating and drinking due to health problems . Also , they are in continous tensions , for variety of reasons . This make their life boring . At young age , you have friends of various interests . This helps you to take part in each and every game . You can go for rock climbing , sea diving , underwater swimming , Formula racing and even to various other sporting events . But as you grow old , your stamina decreases , you are sorrounded by various illness , energy level has decreased a lot . All this factors lead you to keep out of such sporting events . In my country , people are always thinking of other 's view and opinion . This inhibits their desire to break all the rules and become young once again . Wheras young do n't give a penny to such things . They enjoy life in full stretch . They do not care for other 's opinion and do as they want , which is also a prerequisite of enjoyment . There is also othet part of coin . Young people want to live life happily , without a break . So , if something unwanted happen , they get depressed very easily . At this stage , youth require experience of older people to fight this depression . If the young learn to avoid depression and understands thats up and downs are part of life they can easily come over any situation and enjoy life non stop . Thus , it can be easily concluded that , if you want to enjoy life you have to become young again . It is not that older people do n't enjoy but when they enjoy we seldom says that they had return to their young age . This is enough to say that young people enjoy a lot .
(ARA,low) Everyone in the world wishes to have a car . So will the cars be less after twenty years from now ? . Well in my opinion I do n't think that the number of cars will be less . Because people need cars to travel , to work , visit there family or friends , use it as a home if it was a van and it is cheap compear to the other transports . So I dissagree for several reasons : Firstly no one in the world has the ability to o to there work using there legs every morning in there life . Because if that happens everyone will be tired at work and suffuring of legs pain . and that means people will preser to stay at home . Another reason is that as a buisness person for sure cars will be there best way to let the way of the buisness go well . For example when I was in the city of my country . The main thing to travel is to use a car rather than walking . And if the roud is closed just for one hour that means that the buisness will stop or atleast the market will be low . Second comes that cars nowdays are at everywhere in the world . So how it will be fewer than it is now ? . I do n't think that it will be easy to distroy the cars and find a place to burry them under the earth . However , most of the people need cars ( vans ) to use them as their home . that will be a travel home . They can take their home when ever they need to do that . At the end as an ower of as car I hardly beleive that cars will not be fewer in future unless there is a another wirld to throw all the cars in is .
(TUR,high) I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . Previously young people were interested in issues about their communities . However , as the time goes by , as the technology develops young people start getting interested more with their own issues . Integration of modernization and technology can be a reason for this change of interest . Tthus these two can be responsible for the decreasing time that is spent for helping the communities . First of all , the world is changing in a way that people are getting lonelier . For example , most of the people , both mothers and fathers , are working now . Children are left alone at home during the working hours and this makes the children to learn to live by his own . This results in childrens only thinking themselves and children interested in their own isssues . In the long term being alone leads to a society composed of young people who are isolated from the world , only sharing their inner worlds with the poeple like them . Thus as a result of this moderniation in the society , working parents , living in a big city , leads young people to be individualistic . Another reason for the decrease in help of young people to their communities is the development in technology . The development in technology also leads young people to live isolated from the world . As I described above , the children left home alone play computer and video games . They all have some kind of virtual caharacters and they are much more concerned with their vitual caharacters rather than their community . Young people nowadays have more problems regarding themselves than the young people of the past . Thus , they are helping themselve before they try to help their communities . To conclude , with the modernization which leads to loneliness and the developments in the technology which increases the loneliness are the main reasons for young people to behave individualistically . This behavior prevents young people to give enough time to helping their communities .
(CHI,medium) Personally , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . It is for the following reasons . First , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive . Second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be . In addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their communities . First , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive . Today , with the economy growing , people have to earn more money to meet their material desires . In order to make a good living , they spend lots of time to learn skills . On the contrast , during the past , young people made a easy life , they would have more time to care about other people . Second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be . Today , young people are spoiled . Their parents always provide them a good life . They can easily get anything they want , so they do n't appreciate the people who take care of them . Therefore , they are getting more selfish . For example , one of my friends was born and grew up in a weathy family . He always thinks `` money is the world '' . All he cares about is how much money he has . He totally ignore his family , friends and communities . In addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their communities . Parents do n't set a good example for their children to take care or help their communities . Young people need to learn how to be concerned about their communities . In brief , if young people nowadays put more attention on their communities , the whole society will be different . It will become warm and peaceful .
(CHI,medium) Mobile industry has developed for decades and people surely derive lots of benefits from driving cars . In a short time , like five to ten years , people like the ones who enjoy the feeling of driving are still in need of cars that have high quality . However , in a generally longer period , like twenty years , I agree with the speaker 's assertion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . To begin with , now nearlly every country and every city lays special focus on developing and improving its 's public transportation like the building of bus and metroway network . In twenty years time , I am fully convinced that the public transportation will be very well developed and by then people will find taking the public transportion is faster and cheaper than driving their own cars . Secondly , as people becoming more concerned with their health , they may choose to walk or riding a bicycle to work or to other place if it 's not very far from their homes . This also serves to reduce the number of people that buy and drive cars . Thirdly , thanks to the media and education , people are now becoming well aware of the deteriorating effects cars could cause to the environment . Governments are taking out procedures and making regulations to restrict the number of cars . For instance , government would place very heavy tax on the cars that people buy and restrict the times that cars could be used in the city . In sum , the car industry will be survive and the quality of cars they produce will keep on improving in twenty years . However , the quantity of cars is inevitably going to reduce due to the development of public transportion and people 's concern of health and the regulations that the government taking out to protect our environment . I am optimistically to say that the world will be a cleaner and safer place to live in twenty years .
(TEL,high) I agree with the the statement , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities and are too busy spending time on other things . The young people of today claim to be very busy and not to have time for idle pastimes . How much of this is really true ? Cant a youngster fit in about two hours a week into his busy schedule dedicated to community service ? Too many questions with not enough answers . Young people of today do lead more compititive lives . Compitition today is much more than what it was 10 years back . With increased compititition , the student has to put in greater amount of work just to get noticed . However , what youngsters fail to realise is that more leverage is been given nowadays to people who serve the community . As an example , a company that had come to recruit students from my college had given preferance to those that had done some amount of commuinty work as compared to those that havent . Moreover , I feel that , the main time spent by a youngster today is in watching movies , spending time with his or her friends or surfing the internet . The advent of the internet has caused people to become more insulated from one another . People claim that they are very active on the net . Some go to the extent that they use the net for `` social '' causes such as creating a blog after a disaster , such as a flood , war or earthquake . The same youngster goes on to feel very proud of himself . At some point of time , the young person needs to understand that a blog only helps in voicing opinions but dosent help solving problems . Thirdly , i feel the one major thing absent in all youngsters today is a concience that tells them to do good for others . Youngsters seem to have become a selfish lot by caring only about themselves and their comfort . They seem to lack the enthusiasm to go the extra mile to help other people . I feel , this is due to a lack of awareness . Hence , at some time in the school level , all students must be made to do something good for their class or for their friends so that they realise how good it feels to help others . In conclusion , A young person must give more time to helping the community since , if every young person could do just that , the world would become a better place to live in .
(CHI,medium) I agree that people sould keep tring new things nomatter they already know what to do , because of they keep tring new things , and have new ideas , it let us devolope many new things , and when everything keep getting better , it 's mean that we are keeping process . They keep finding new things , so our tecknowlege can be really good these day . Because when the new things come out people will use it for sometimes , but after that people will wants to use better things , so they will tring to find so more convenience things to use . If people did n't try to make some new products , and people wo n't support them . Like music , althout every composers follow privent composers , they still will try to add many differents idea in the music , or broke the rule , and built the new rule , than it will bring the music to the other peried . When we compered these days music and the Romaness music . It 's not only the style very different . We can also find many differents interest things on it , because we learn what 's the idea of the music before , and what we can do some new , or make the sounds different , so music will keep changing by day to day . People have to keep tring the new things and take new risks , not only doing what they already know how to do , that will let our life become very boring , because we want to make our world and our life better and better , not just staying at the some step .
(GER,medium) I THINK THAT MOST ADVERTISEMENTS MAKE PRODUCTS SEEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE . THIS IS , OF COURSE , A KIND OF CHEATING TO THE CUSTOMERS ON ONE HAND . BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ITS JUST NORMAL . IT DEVELOPED LIKE THIS OVER THE TIME , COURSED BY MANY REASONS . I THINK THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES ABOUT ADVERTISEMENT : TOUCHING AND SEEING . IF PEOPLE WATCH ADVERTISEMENT , FOR EXAMPLE IN THE TELEVISION , THE ARE JUST ABLE TO SEE THE PRODUCT , AND NOT TO TOUCH IT . AS THE TOUCHING AF A PRODUCT , AND THE DEVELOPING PERSONAL FEELING BASED ON THE TEXTURE OF IT , IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR HUMANS TO GET AN OPINION ABOUT A PRODUCT , ADVERTISEMENT IS ALWAS KIND OF CHEATING ... WELL , IN MY OPINION THIS IS COURSE ENOUGH NOT TOO WATCH ADVERTISEMENT , BUT MANY PEOPLE STILL DO . I STATE , THAT IF PEOPLE DO NOT TOUCH A PRODUCT , THEY CAN NOT GET A REAL OPINION OF IT . THE STATEMENT THAT MOST PRODUCTS LOOK MUCH BETTER IN ADVERTISEMENTS IS EVEN MORE CORRECT AS MANY COMPANIES TREAT THE ADVERTISED PRODUCTS VERY HARD BEFORE USING IT . A GOOD EXAMPLE FOT THIS IS THE MC DONALDS BURGER . MC DONALDS IS , TRUELY , PAINTING THE BURGER THEY USE IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT . THIS PAINTING MAKES THE BUERGER LOOK MORE JUCY , MORE TASTY . THIS BEHAVIOR IS WHAT I REALLY CALL CHEATING . THE COMPANIES CAN NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CAN NOT TOUCH THEIR PRODUCTS IN TELEVISION . BUT THEY SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE ORIGINAL VIEW OF THE PRODUCT TO GIVE PEOPLE A WRONG , BUT BETTER SELLING VIEW , OF IT . ADVERTISEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST WAY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS TO THE PEOPLE . THROUGH THE LAST CENTURIES IT APEARED IN MANY DIFFERENT KINDS . STARTING WITH LOCAL ADVERTISEMENTS IN SMALL NEWSPAPERS OR JUST ON THE STREET MANY YEARS AGO , THE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT IF TECNOLOGIE OVER THE LAST YEARS MAKES ADVERTISEMENT APPEAR NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD , AT ANY TIME OF A DAY . IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A BIG SIGN OF COKE ADVERTISEMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF AFRICA . THROUGH THE TECNOLOGIE CAMPANIES FROM JAPAN ARE ABLE TO ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCTS IN GERMANY AS WELL AS IN INDIA . MY OPINION TO THE ADVERTISEMENT OF TODAY IS THAT NEARLY ALL PRODUCTS SEEM TO BE BETTER THAN THEY REALLY ARE , BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE PRODUCING AND SELLING COMPANIES ARE ALL ABLE TO USE THE NEW TECNOLOGIES FOR THEIR ADVERTISEMENT . THE NEW TECNOLOGIE LIKE TELEVISION , MOBILE PHONE , RADIO AND SO ON MAKES THE HUMANS ALWAYS AVALIABLE AND REACHABLE FOR NEW INFORMATION . AND AS THE HUMANS DO NEARY ALL RELY ON THE TECNOLOGIE , ( EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF IT ) ITS EVEN MORE EASY FOR COMPANIES TO INTRODUCE AND , IN FACT , FAKE THEIR ADVERTISED PRODUCTS .
(ARA,low) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use thene ther are today . Some people agree with thes statment and some do n't . There are many advanteges and disadvanteges for it . The advanteges of having cars or not are many such as the air polution will be less because many people will use bicks . The second thing is people will not need to pay for gas every week . The weather in my country is very hot so we must use cars espsialy is summer and that is a disadvanteges of not having cars . At the end my opinion is that I disagree with this statment because the weather is to hot in my country and no one can walk or us a bick is such a hot weather .
(ITA,high) I think it is a difficult question because it can have two simliar meanigns . First if it is better for a student to know the theory rather than the practise aspect ; but it can mean also , if it is better for a student to understand a concept rather than the fact which the concept come from . In this second meaning , for example , if it better for a student to learn principal political ideas of the French Revolution or to learn facts that brought to the revolution ; or to know causes and effects of the Second World War or to know personal Hitler history . I think that there is not a more important thing between understanding ideas and learning facts . In fact , education cannot be only theoryc . So I do not agree with the statement . For example , in chemestry , student cannot learn only formulas . He-she has to do experiments , otherwise science cannot go on , because theories have to be proved . Maybe only who studies philosophy can learn only ideas of ancient Greek or Roman philosophers , for instance . That means that who works only with concepts can have an abstract way of learning . Even though also in this field there is a sort of evolution . For example , some branches of philosophy , of Humanities , like Antropology has to study human behaviour so it has to know facts . In the field I study , that is law , facts are really important . Eve though there are many rules , we cannot use only them to give a legal advise . We need to refer to facts that really happened .
(ARA,medium) Actully i agree for the students to understand the ideas and conecpts before learing the facts because the facts at the biggining was un idea then devloped till came fact . for any students going to make any study he have to develop the idea of his subjects and make plan how to make fact in order to be acceted other wise no body will support his idea . The students when they are preseting any project they make it or any study they do they should start showing how they reach this fact which is the result of thier project or study . In order to make this fact accepted from the teachers whose evaluting their study they have to show the idea of the project then the concept which they follow and the results which is the fact . Any students whose not start his learning from knowing the ideas and the concepts and going directlly to study the facts his knowlage base will be weak . Knowing the ideas it will help for future growing and developmet and improvment . All te scince start as ideas then devloped ti they came as fact . And since all discoverd technolgis start as ideas then develped till reach which we see in our world know ( very advanced and high tech . ) . we should learn our students to belave in studying the ideas till they reach the facts and this is for more development in the future . Know every student who have un idea he will go and work hard to make it fact by follwing the concept but if he learn only the facts he will be not able to develope him self . so that let all the atudents start studying the ideas and how it v \ come fact at the
(CHI,medium) Once there has been an interesting TV program about our tranportations . There were 2 people both travelling from point A to point B at the same time , one by private car and the other one taking the public transportation , and not surprisingly the result showed that the second man got point B earlier because there are too many cars on our streeet nowadays . But how about in twenty years time , will it still be same or will it make a change ? I do believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the following reasons . Been annauced that the oil price was increase and would be raise again later this year as a result of the war in the middle-east , the private car divers are experising higher gas cost which might tight their financial situations . That 's why in the furture there might be more people who would like to give up their cars and go on the public transport . Secondly , althought there are weathly persons who are care about the increase in the oil price they are likely to stuck in the traffice jam in the early morning to their offices . One survey has shown that although the government are trying to put more attention on the motor way to reduce the terrible traffice jam especially during the rush hour , the consumption of cars is speeding much faster . That 's we could rarely see any improvement in our road which might force some of the drivers to give up their cars . Thirdly after can not any benefit of the development on the motor ways the government is actrually working on the public transport which can take more people at one time . There are seperate bus roads on the ground to enhance they are travelling smoothly ; there are some rebuilt of the undergroud to make it more convinence and capable to travel with ; there are even more rail service undercontruction to improve our daily transport . Although there are some people who are still agruing how comfortable to be in their cars , I think if considering how much time they would have wasted during the traffic jam they would change their minds . After twenty year I believe that people will be even more busy than now , and being provided a faster and equally comfortable choice of travelling , I can not see any reason why they would not give up the cars . That 's why I also believe that there would be fewer cars in our city .
(ITA,high) thinking that the students of today will be the people that will rule the world tomorrow makes me agree partially with the statement . Infact , what would happend if two leaders of two different countries had to solve a problem concerning international relations . If they only based their decision on facts that happened in the past , instead of analyzing and understanding the problem , they would probably take the wrong decision . Nevertheless the same thing would probably happend if they did not consider or know any solution to past problems similar to the one they are facing now . If a student is capable of understanding ideas and concepts he will be able to manage any situation regarding those ideas and concepts . He will be able to analyze and study the problem in depth and , at the end , come out with a `` tailor made '' solution . This is important because if you only learn facts you treat every similar situation in the same way , with the same solution , wich will probably be the wrong one . This is because every situation is peculiar , it has millions of different variables , and , to solve a problem concerning that situation you have to know most of them , and that happens only if you understand the concepts that are behind that precise situation . However , learning facts is important because if you do not rely on past experiences as a pattern for future decisions it is likely to take the wrong decision anyway . What I would like to point out is the fact that both of these approach on how students should study are necessary because they compensate each other . If you combine the them you increase drastically the possibility of finding a solution to problems concerning a topic because you understood the concepts and ideas that are behind it and you can compare a possible solution with the solutions that somebody else took for a similar problem . In my opinion , a balanced mixture of both the two methods would be the best solution , that is why I only partially agree with the statement .
(KOR,medium) People have their own way to enjoy their life . Old , young , men , women they all spend their time differently as the way they want . However , some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Some people would disagree with this statement because younger people do n't really know about the life than older people because they did n't experience their life as long as older people did . However , as for me , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because younger people have more contact with their friends , and activities to enjoy . First , young people has many organization to keep contact with their friends and also make new relations with others such as facilities like schools , or mediums like blogs . They meet others through these organization and keep contact with them . With many friends , they can fully enjoy their life rather than being alone . Old people however , seems to have difficulty in keeping in touch with their old friends so they spend most of their time alone , or with their family . For example , when travelling alone , I enjoy it for the first day , but as time goes by I find it routine to take picture of only land scapes , and eating alone . But when I travel with my friends , we can take picture of each other , and talk and chatter while transporting to the next place to tour . It is more enjoyable to be with friends than being alone . Second , young people know what they want and what they like . They would rather spend their time doing what they like than working over-time for more incomes . They can spend their leisure time doing whatever they want since they have more entertaing programs which did n't exist at old people 's young era . For example , when I have leisure time I can go and see exibition , movie theater , or sporting event . Most of old people does n't like these activities because they did n't experience these when they were young . Instead they have interests in activities which seem to be routine to youngs , such as gardening , or fishing . In conclusion , even people have their own way to enjoy their life , young people knows how to enjoy their life more , because they have medium to help them to keep contact with their friends , and facilities to enjoy their spare time .
(JPN,high) I agree with this statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . There are two reasons to support . First of all , it will be boring for them to learn only the fact . If the student just only learn the fact , they will be satisfied with their knowledge and wo n't try to think any more . Thinking is a important process to improve their knowledge . If they just learn the fact , they do n't need to think why it happened or how it happened . They will just know the answer right away without thinking . In fact , thinking is exciting . When they learn an idea , they will try to use it in many situations . For example , when students learn about static electricity , they will try to make electirical shocks by rubbing objects and find out which objects makes the most electricity . They are thinking and also enjoying the method . But if they know the fact , they will just chose the right object and done . That is very boring . Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts are very important . From my experience , I really think so . When I was playing basketball in middle school , I just did as the coach said to me during practice . I did n't really think about why are we doing this practice and just did as we were told to do . But as time goes by , our team became weaker and weaker . We searched for the reason . Finally we found out the reason . Every practice we did had a meaning . We were n't just running , we were running as if we are in the game . We were n't just shooting , we were shooting as if there are opponents blocking . We were just doing the fact that the coach said but we should have understand the idea and concepts of the practice . After we noticed the fact , we started to work hard and we became the second place in the competition . I was really happy and thanked the coach for teaching us for not telling the answer and made us think by ourseves . From this experience , I learned that understanding ideas and concepts are far more important that learning facts . This is why I agree with this statement .
(FRE,high) Usually students do n't really understand why ideas and concepts are tought in schools or universities rather than facts . Which of these two notions is more important ? Let 's weigh the pros and cons in order to have a clear opinion on this subject . I usually ask myself `` what am I doing here ? '' while attending a math course . Indeed like me most of the students I do n't really understand the point of learning math which is totally absract . It is always about numbers added to each others , multiplied , equations , solutions ! I 'm not very keen on this subject but in this case I see no solution . For instance , we all know that becoming a brilliant architect or a great physician is impossible without acquiring math notions and knowledge , but how can this knowledge be useful when we do n't really understand how it can be applied on our everyday 's life ? In biology for example we learn how the human body is constructed , its anatomy , its strengths and weaknesses . These scientifical facts are useful at any time ! By learning biology we are able to understand the reasons of the consequences : how our brains command each and every move of our body ... This example also applies to physics as this subject is tought by showing experimental works and displaying to the students the reasons of all the phenomenons that happen on our planet for instance . Newton 's falling apple lead him to discover gravity that lead to the explanation of other events . But in the end it is always about math ! These eplanations can only be proved by this important science and that 's the main reason why this subject must be tought , although its useless apperance which veiles one of the most important aspects of sciences . To put this in a nutshell , it appears that facts would n't exist whitout ideas and concepts as the proof of a general fact is impossible whitout demonstrating hypothesis by experiments and calculus . Even if facts are closer to reality than concepts , these two topics ca n't be taken apart , they depend on each other .
(SPA,medium) To consider a person inteligent and well prepeared , he or she has to know about several areas of the human knowledge . I am sure that if you meet a person that , for example , has studied mathematics but also has done a coruse of American literature , you will find him or her more interesting than someone who has only studied a science subject or only an humanity one . It is better to handle many academic subjects that specialize in only one , because then one talk and discuss diverse topics and not be restricted to an specific one . When colleges or companies inteview a candidate who wants to get admitted or get a job , they expect not only that this person knows about the field he or she is applying to or has studied , but also to be able to speak and integrate to his work other aspects that his field does not cover . For example , if you hire an architect that combines functionality with art , the result is something better than it would be just a regular functional edification . It is important not to confuse what has been said with another very different thing . When it is said that is better to know about several aspects instead of just one , it means knowing deeply each area , not just few information about many subjects . As human raze evolutions , there are more things to know and to read about , that it is why that a person who acomplishs to do it , is considered a
(HIN,high) In my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people . This is a very evident fact and can be said based on reasons . Firstly , Younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people . Young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment . While older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude . Older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lays ahead . So , younger people many times enjoy themselves by taking up risky sports like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing . Secondly , the phsical conditions of older people does not many times allow them to move to different places and perform many fun related activities . While the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get less tired . So , they can enjoy by taking up sports , long country tour and other similar activities as a source of enjoyment for themselves . Also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the changes in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoos , playing games on computer and using various eletronic items like i-pods and mp3 player . Lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy as much as younger people due to other limitations . Older people have many responsibilities of family , work and society on them . So , they are not able to enjoy themselves as much as young people who are free from these responsibilities and have much more time to enjoy . Therefore , it can be said that due to carefree , flexible and risk taking nature of young people it is possibe for them to enjoy more than the adults who are less flexible and have much more responsibilities on themselves .
(KOR,medium) This year , one of Korean reseach institutes announed that less numer of young people take time to help their communities compared to their parents generation . I think not many youth are helping their communities because they are not interested in communities and do not know the importance of it . First , as western culture started to come into Korea in 1950s ' , individualism spread out through the country . Before , Koreans put communities and groups at a higher position that individuals . However , young people nowadays tend to think about themselves and disregard communities . For example , in Korea , there had been communities for residents who live nearby . Although apartment has replaced small houses , this tradition continued and residents in the same line got together regularily and discussed about the problems in the community . However , recently , this group meeting lost its position and finally disappeared in many towns . This is the evidence that more and more people do not care about their communities . Second , the wrong education is one of the reasons . For Korean high school students , study is the only thing to do not only at school but in everywhere . They are taught to only study hard to enter a famous university . From my personal experience , I used to came home after 11 o'clock to study at school . On top of that , this trained students do not change their attitude after entering university . Even though university students have much more free time , usually they do not spend their time helping their communities because they are not used to it . In conclusion , changed concept of individuals and communities and egnorance of the importance to participate on helping communites are the main reason why young people do not make it . By changing the educat
(CHI,medium) From my perspective , I do agree with the concept of young people nowaways do not give enough time to helping their communities . The reason why I have a strong feeling towards it is because that for the past four years I have been helping at the orphanage constantly , but I seldom find any other young adult like me who is willing to take part of their time off in a week or a month to help out those who are in needs . Maybe I am being too harsh on my peers for asking them to give something back for their community , but somehow I start seeing my country , Taiwan , has becoming a place with cold-hearded younger generations . Since I am a person who walks between the two worlds , the United States and Taiwan , I share my equal halves on both of my homes . I often sign up community survives with my peers in the States to just more or less make our community better , and to provide some care and love for the people who really need it . Most importantly , I feel happiness around , and some senses of having a meaningful life . I even see more young adults in the States are willing to help out their community by doing any kind of service . Maybe that is why the States is still growing as a steadlily country , and this is something that my Chinese folks will never understand . There might be some factors for causing this kind of tragedy . Students here are still being punished with corperal punishments , and their teachers always brainwash them by telling them that school and grades come first , and nothing else is far more important than academics . Maybe therefore kids stop concerning about what they should actually be caring about . The outside world is no longer a huge impact on their life besides schooling . I think this is one of the major problems which drag young people to become less prone to serving back their communities . What we need in the society now is someone who has broader horizon , and audacious enough to show some passions to encourage our young people to once be able to provide some time to help out their communities . Sometimes I do feel it is a posterous thing to realize that there are less people who are willing to assist their communities , but I certainly do understand that it is because of the surrounding people are living in , with pressure and income difficulties , that they cannot even have a time to rest and think about the things that will bring love and happiness to other people and their further generations .
(HIN,high) I agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . I agree with the statement because in this competitive world of today one has to really master his skills in a wide variety of subjects rather to specialize in one subject . In this modern world the technology has so much advanced that without having a broad knowledge about a variety of subjects a person cannot becom successful . Having a knowledge about a variety of subjects not only improve his intellectual power of thinking but will also improve his effficiency at work . A person cannot succeed in his work if he does n't have thorough knowledge of his subjects . For example , medical field has become so advanced and has introduced so many latest techniques that without thier thorough knowledge it would n't be possible to even operate a machine . A simple example of such machine is MRI which is also known as the Magnetic Resonance Imaging . Its basically consist of two parts one the hard ware part and the other is the software part . Hardware part consists of all the mechanical systems including the couch and magnets and the software part consists of the computer system where imaces of the different parts of the body are acquired and saved for further evalution . Now the hardware part is based on the engineering perspective and a requires a person to have a thorogh knowledge of it to operate the machine and should know the function of each part . On the other hand software part requires a thorough knowledge of different softwares like the different languages used in the compiter then he should also be able to study the images . So , in order perform any tast seuccesfully person shuold have a broad knowdledgwe of all the subjects rather than one
(TUR,medium) human kinds always need ideas , concepts and facts to reach good life satandards , therefore understanding them is a very important respect for humans life . everyone has different point of views about the idea of concepts , ideas and facts . some assume that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in , contrary to those , some think that learning facts is more important than understanding them . i personally agree with the second idea because of some reasons . i think facts are basic things to understand things and they are both real and nondebated things . first of all , facts are informations which people should leran to reach a thought . if a person does not have any information about a topic he or she can not say any thing about the topic . for example a student is required to say his or her thoughts by his or her teacher about a school lesson first he or she must read and search about the topic and must get information about lesson to have any idea about it . facts are real things . they are basics of thought . we can not create and idea or concept without learning them . so facts must be teached the students in schools . in addition to this , facts are real things which make us more intelligent and add us extra knowledge . so we should teach them to our children before they gain ability to understand ideas and concepts . by that way ever thing may be more clear for them . they will not face any problem while establishing an idea or concept . owner of ideas must know about facts too . at last but not least , as i talked about a little before facts are real information which have no doubt . so we can not discuss about facts but ideas and concepts are special for people they can be debated because of this reason . so to not confuse childrens mind , teachers should talk about facts and they should teach facts to them . for example 2 adn 2 is 4 it is a well known fact and very clear for every one but an idea of a someone else may not be clear for every one . all people may not be agree about the idea of a person . it is a very natural situation i think . so that shows what important is the teaching of facts . all in all , as i said before , learning about facts is more important because of both being basic things and also real things as well as no one has a chance to debate a fact . the long and the short of it is that it is more important for students to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts .
(TUR,low) In the last few years technology is updating itself rapidly . To follow the new invents become very difficult nowadays . Especially one of the main problem which we have in our lives is transportation . The scientists are trying lots of things to help all the world people about this problem . Can you imagine what will happen10 years later ? If technological investmesments go on rapidly and scientists work so hard , it is not a different evnet to become having fewer cars in twenty years . First of all , let us look at the devolopment which have done in the last 10 years . Ten years ago , it was not thought that everyone would have mobile telephones and comminucate to each other without any cable . Perhaps the people who heart that had a smile on their faces because that is not posible for them to have anything like this . When it comes to fewer car event , this is not impossible in this view . The other thing which we must consider is the way of technology about transportatin . Although many wide any confortable roads are done , There is still no solution for this problem . But in last years , the number of travellers increasing faster than before . So , investmens will be much more on air transportatin . As we see in cartoons , this can be possible , too . On conclusion , we can say that , because of unexpected fast devolopment about technology , the use of cars will probably decrease and instead of that the air transportation , it will probably be choosen by many people . If you see some flying cars on the air a feew years ago , do not be afraid . That day probably is this day .
(ITA,medium) I agree with the statement . Today young people think only about themselves and their problems instead of giving time to helping their communities . They want only enjoy themselves having a lot of hobbies and going out with their friends . I know few young people who do activities for aThey withdraw from the reality which sometimes is full of people that is sad and have phisical or economic problems . Young people do n't want to see that there are persons who have to be helped and are near to them . But there are also a lot of associations that want to do something to help who is in a difficult condition . I think that everyone should care their communities because he is part of society and if he tries to change a bad reality he lives better too . Young people should have more respect to others because they are the future and it should have to be better than the present .
(TEL,medium) Specialisation and having a broad knowledge of many different subjects are both equally important . Both specialisation and general knowledge should co exist together for a society to evolve Specialists are the people who study deeply about a specific subject . They try to gain as much knowledge of the subject as possible . Specialists are needed where the surface knowledge about the subject is not enough . For example if a patient is having a skin problem , initialy a general practioner will try to find a cure , but if the problem is too deep then a skin specialist comes into the picture . So a specialist is needed whenever a problem is too specific . But a specialist has a danger of getting isolated in his own work and miss the big picture Having a broad knowledge helps a person to see the big picture . It helps a person to see the co relation between different things . The problem is viewed from every angle and also in corelation to other things . A generalist is needed to see in which direction the society is moving . He is needed to address the bigger problems of the society . Thus both general knowledge and specialistion are needed and should complement each other for a society to function successfully
(TUR,medium) There is a big difference between the concept of having an extra information about one academic topic in terms of having a enough information and knowledge about more than one academic subject . According to me I prefer to have exra information about one topic instead of having knowledge about more than one topic . Because of some reasons as such ; being happy or earning more money . First of all ; Having an extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist about this area . it is so important feature about making your job good . If you improve yourself really extraordinarily about a specific subject , it also brings you success and powerty . For instances ; you are a doctor and you are really successfull in your job . Everyone could know you because of your ability to reach the goals , as a result you will be a person who is unique in your area . Also this success could bring you happiniess and money at the same time . You will be happy because you are doing your job good and people are admiring you about your high ability about this subject . For example you are the doctor who will find a solution for the cancer . Because you are just focused on the this topic and there is nothing to prevent your success . At the same time speciality will bring you a money . They all related things . For instance again ; if you are a doctor and you are doing your job and everyone knows you , it means that you will have lots of patients and you will gain much more money . on the other hand ; you are a doctor but at the same time you want to be a engineer or historian . But unfortunatley it s not possible to become really succesfull for every department . Because all these subject are different from each other and the human could not have enough capacity to achieve these goals at the same time . As a consequence : you could not reach the same power and respect unlike being a specialist consequnetly : according to me being a successful only one are instead of more than one , is a really goood and important thing . Because it could give you extra adventages like earning more money or being happy .
(HIN,medium) Unfortunately , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . Nowadays life has become very complicated and exhaustive , not only for adults but also for young people . There is a lot of competition in every field . The young generation is so occupied by their own lives that they hardly have any time for community services . Students have to work much harder compared to our parents in order to be successful in their life . A lot of the time has to be devoted for studying . A good education is given much more importance than earlier . Secondly there are many more recreational activities nowadays . With the invention of high-tech video games , computer games like the Sony playstations and X-box the level of entertainment has reached a whole new level . Then there is television and Internet on which you can view an unlimited amount of things twenty four hours a day . For sports fans there are various sorts channels like ESPN and Star Sports on which a large number of sports are covered ranging form cricket to baseball . The young people spend a lot of time on the Internet chating , E-mailing etc . People would rather spend time enjoying and entertaining themselves instead of helping others . The young generation is selfish and ignores the needs of the community . They are more concerned about there future and do not care about the community 's future . They do not understand the importance of a good community . Therefore I agree with the statement .
(SPA,medium) Many people dedicated a lot of time on knowing and investigating diferent topics , but when you ask them about something specific they do not know what to say . While other people spend their time focused in one subject and you are sure that whatever you ask him , he will be able to answer to it . I totally disagree with the statement because i think that when you try to know more about everything you just ca n't because is too much information from diferent topics and your brain ca n't support as many information as you want . For example when i was a little girl for about four moths I tried to memorize all the math operations even if a could n't make them there was always a calculator but after that I got confused with everything because I could n't recognize the operations anymore . I 'm not sure if it was becuase I forgot or I did n't practice but I was n't able to make them , not even with calculator . After that I started with my normal class some things were familiar but all my effort of doing all those math problems and graphs and everything did n't have any result . Whatsmore I realized that in my ambition of knowing everything I lost a whole vacation full with fun and distractions . Therefore i never tried again to learned everything from one step . I go step by step instead of jumping . And now that I 'm just to start a new part of my life I know that everything comes at its ' moment and that knowing to many things can distract you from what you really want for your life . I 'm not saying that you have to be an ignorant or like a pony that is not able to see the sides and just looks the road , what I mean is that you have to be focused on what you are doing and on what you want so when it comes the time to show your knowlege you are sure and you do n't hesitate .
(CHI,medium) In my opinion , I do not agree with the assertion becasue there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities . With the advent of Internet or other media , people have become easiler to get information that their community need them to help . For example , in my apartment , the memebers of commitee announces the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up certain event . And they often receive a lot of responses that say they would like to help . Comparing to the past , there are few people informed that they are needed to help something . Thus , I contrarily think more and more yound peole involve in community activies becasue they are more familier with the internet than the people before , and understand they are in demand . In addition , in my shcool , university always encourage students to do something that can benefit our community or society . For example , they are encouraged to clean the streets and help teach older people who are illiterate to read . University do not pay the student that do service for community . Nevertheless , many students often come to sign up for doing this kind of service . Perhaps they will receive award , such as a certificate or a mendal instead of money . But after all , they do involve in and understandour society and community . When you broaden the scale to our society , you can also see that there are more and more institutions which encourage young peple to help disable people . For example , in my country , we have `` Sun Shine '' gas stations , which only hire disable people and young peole who are willing to help those disability . Inconclusion , I think that we have more chances for young people to hlep our communities becasue there are more ways they can choose to serve their own communities . This can be seen whether at shcool or our society or even in an apartment comunity .
(CHI,high) I agree that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well '' . As we are in the 21 century , the world is fast changing , so we need to keep learning new things so that we can keep up with the world 's step . If someone wants to be susseccful , only follow the others is definitly not enough . A successful man , a talent , must know have to lead behind the people , he must always be one step faster than the ordinary people , thus taking risks is quite necessary . Only follow the traditions and rules and do the things `` what they already how to do well '' will never make people successful and even may destroy them , makes them the ones how can not follow the changing world . People should not hesitate to take risks . Talents take risks , they never afriad of losing because it will only make them stronger . No one can deny that Thomas Edison is a successful man . He is probably the most famous inventor of the world ; he is the father of modern light . What does a inventor do everyday ? He takes risk . If Thomas Edison has not invented modern light , the world will be complete different today . Another example of successful people try new things and take risk is founder of Microsoft Corporation , Bill Gates . He has studied in a famous university but he has stopped doing `` what he already know how to do well '' . He has quited from the university and has started his own business . Now , he is the richest man is the world . He owns billions of dollars and everyone who has a personal computer use his `` Windows '' software program . He is successful and he takes risks . `` Only doing what they already know how to do well '' only makes people nobodies . Every year , millions of skilled and experienced old worker in developing countries like China , retire from factories . They have kept doing their works , `` what they already know how to do well '' every workday . When they finally retired , they have found that they are nobodies and are not successful at all . It is their fault that they have not taken risks . If they have started business or got other creative ideas , they may have much better lives now . In conclusion , successful people are more likely to take risks .
(ARA,high) I agree that a person who wants to be succesfull in his life must have a broad knowlegde of a vast majority of academic subject . First of all when a person is in the process of having a coversation with any one he will have an idea of what to talk about during there discussion . For example if you were taking to your dad 's freind who is a doctor that is specialised in the heart it would be useful to have some background of how the heart functions and its stucture . It could also prove useful as genaral knowledge during day to day activities . For example if you were asked to buy a certain product at a supermarket you would need to know how to determine whether this particular product is benefcial or not . This could be achieved if the basic knowledge of business studies is available to you . It could also help in your scocial life by allowing be to become more closer towards you . This means that you would be able to gain and select form a larger range of people to become your friends . Being specailised on certain area sometimes promotes bordem due to every day repetion of tasks . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects also has some disadvantages to it . Firstly it promotes unspecialisation in people since they only have minmal knowledge in a certain subject . It also resricts a person from having a job were he is good at and is specialised at . It also makes a person seem unprofessional since he has no real skill to give to the working world and society itself therefore he/she has no contribution . Also people who are specialised most of the time obtain a higher salary than people who are not professional or specialised .
(FRE,high) Conflicts between generations have been aroud for centuries and still generate much debate . Older generations often disapprove of the behaviour of young people , and this disapproval is obvious in the way that we understand young people 's commitment to their community . Although I acknowledge the generous contribution of some young people in helping their community , I agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . In the last three years , I have volunteered as a tutor for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and for various jobs at university . I feel that it is very important to help one 's community , but when I try to think of examples of such generosity in my fellow students and in younger people , I struggle to find two examples . I only need to look at the employment website of my university to see that the voluntary jobs being advertised are not popular ; the website counts the number of times that a page is seen and that number is particularly low for voluntary activities . If we forget about volunteering and think of helping one 's community as just spending time with that community and taking part in its activities , one will still find that young people are rather absent . Life has become a very private enterprise now . The advent and the popularity of video games , the internet and mobile phones shows that it is now possible to enjoy oneself without leaving a room . It is possible to be part of a virtual community ( in chat rooms for instance ) without having to spend any time with the local community . This privatization of entertainment and of life in general means that young people seem much less concerned about their direct community and are more focused on themselves . Most teenagers are rather self-absorbed and forget about the community around them . For instance , my sister is often more concerned about the outfit that she is going to wear the next day than about sick members of the family . She feels that she does not have any time to spend with my grandmother , so absorbed is she in her fashion concerns . In a way , young people are involved in another community . It seems that communities have become much bigger in the last century . While a few decades ago events happened at a local and community level , the development of information and communication has led to an enlargement from a village community to a world community . In the 1900s , people would listen to the news of their community , of their village , and maybe of the nearest town , but today we learn about the world on the news . Although young people might be part of that community , there is still little sign of them truly helping in that community . I therefore do agree that young people do not spend enough time helping their community . However , they should not necessarily be blamed for this ; we just need to give them a sense of community to make them want to participate in that community ; it is up to parents and to the educational system to achieve this for a better world .
(GER,medium) I do not agree with this statement . In my opinion it is much more important to be good in one specific subject then to know a litte about many subjects . So I think you do not need any people who know a little about everything . They are not valuable to the academic issues . For example it needs to find a solution on a problem that is much specific , like improving social conditions . There you need no knowledge about global warming or the different planets on the milkyway . On the other hand you need no knowledge of the social structure if you want to find a solution of global warming . So in my opinion our society needs specialists and no allrounders without a deeper knowledge of a specific subject . Of course it would be nice if you are a specialist on a subject but also know something about the other topics . But firstly you need to get the special knowledge of one thing before you may care about other issues . There is no goal in knowing a little about everything . The people who know a litte about everything can participate on conversations about certain topics but they are not valuable to solve problems which need a higher level of knowledge . Every part of society needs specialists . Even our chancellor has her specialists who are involved in the problems which belong to their field of knowledge . So specialist are the most important people in every government , company and even family . So for me it is important to become similar with one subject what means becoming a specialist . This is the reason why I disagree with this statement . Specialist on academic topics keep the world spinning around . Withouth those guys there could not be found any solution for problems which require a high level of knowledge .
(GER,high) In my opinion , the given statement is right on the one hand , but it is not able to be used to every specific subject on the other . Classes of different subjects have always been different and will always require different strategies to handle the material which is taught in them . For those subjects who tend to be in the technical and scientific area , understanding the main way of working is far more important than any detail . In general , understanding the facts of how something , e.g. a motor of an entire power plant works is more important than learning and knowing any single detail without really knowing what purpose they are for . In my opinion , especially scientific subjects like chemistry or biology and technical subjects like engineering will get along wonderfully with that statement . For those kinds of students , it has to be important to understand the function of techniques they are confronted with while attending their classes , omitting minor details ( which are often omitted by professors and teacher themselves ) . After university , being confronted with your job , there is no use for those who learned by heart any single detail of a machine they are confronted with now , but not knowing the way this particular machine works in general . In addition to that , minor details are also often described right on the machine , but their general way of working is not and should have been understood earlier . Moreover , I think ideas and concepts are were and still are the basement for development and research . With monotonously learning and repeating facts , it is far more difficult to understand and without knowing about the core concept , there is no possibility for progress and new development , e.g. in the medicine and biochemistry . But nevertheless , understanding the concepts is not always the one way to success . Being very helpful in technical subjects , I still think that you should not use this method in subjects like History . In these specific classes , detailed facts of our past are equal in importance as understanding the concept , e.g. the concept of communism invented by Lenin . To put it in a nutshell , I am convinced that the given statement , which is to concentrate on an idea than to the facts , can be very useful for everything concerning development and technique , but it should not be used to those classes that deal with the past . In these particular subjects , you should spend half the time for the ideas and the other half for the facts .
(JPN,low) Young people nowday do not give enough time to helping their communities . In my opinion , I certainly do not agree with this question . Nowdays , many young people would like to spends time with their own will . However , it does not mean they do not give enough time to helping their communities , just their own will comes first and it is more important than helping their communities to young people . However , there are many kinds of communities such as their interests , friends , even theri families would be count as one of the communities . Although , families are one of their communities , i still believe that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their `` communities '' . The reason why I think young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , even though it is their family , is the time they live . Nowdays , young people are able to have fun with many things such as playing video games , having a party , and going to an amusement park . Young people can do anything they want to do without communities . However , if they spend time to helping their communities , they still have some time to have fun the way they want to , but it is not what they want . They want to have their own time , not with the communities .
(FRE,medium) I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but they are several reasons for this and it is not always the case . With the huge rising of cumsumption society , more and more products are proposed to the customers . Most of the products are really similar . How make the difference between two bottles of water witch have the same price ? This is the role of Communication and advertising . Companies will presents the products in the better way . They will associate to it a lot of qualities and significations . With advertising , companies create the image of the product , and it is this image which makes the difference when the customers buy the products . So , the customers do n't have to mix the real qualities and specificities of a product and his image . For example , a brand of water showed in one of his advertisements babies dancing and swimming in waters . That does n't mean that each person who drinks this water becomes a baby and ju ; p directly into a swimming pool . A second problem problem for companies is How sell a cake or a fragrance by advertising ? People ca n't taste or smell the product . Consequently , advertisements suggest the flavour or the tast of the product , and as everybody has his personal tasts and preferences , everybody do n't always agree with the advertisement . Finaly , advertising do n't alwys presents the products in a better way than reality . Advertisements are controlled by law and associations of customers . Companies ca n't lye about thier products , lying advertising is punished by lawm and in this case the company looses all his credibility and the trust of his customers . To conclude , advertising make product seem better to make business . It does n't lye , it improve the reali
(GER,high) I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Many young people nowadays do not pay enough attention to other peoples needs but are preoccupied with their own problems and activities . On the other hand they use facilities given by their communities like youth centers and sports facilities and even schools which are mostly run by the community . This stresses the point that many young people only take instead of taking and giving back . They do not seem to realize that most of the facilities they use every day are run or at leat supported by their communities . From these points one can draw the conclusion that young people should defenitely do something in order to give back to their communities . Examples of what they could do for their community are on the one hand helping to keep all these facilities they use everyday running thus helping to keep places like parks , public transport and sports facilities clean and intact . On the other hand they should also see what they can do for other people and their interests and needs . Young people could e.g. help older people with their shopping , go to elderly homes and read books or newspapers to the people or play games with them . That way they would socalize with other groups and give back to the community what they give to young people . Also , young people should try to contribute to local issues like politics and demonstrations in order to support their community in important topics . Through these activities they would improve the living standard everyone is getting profit from now and that they are getting profit from in the future . To draw a conclusion young people should give more of their spare time to their community in order to socialize and get into contact with other groups of people and also to give back part of the effort adults make to have the younger enjoy their environment and facilities .
(TUR,medium) Technology is in a fast progress . Since the invention of the televisions , people have been spending much more time in front of them . As a result , the researchers find out that advertising the products on tvs or on billboards will catch so many people 's eyes . But i , personally dont believe the general idea of the community . I dont think the better the product is advertised , the better it is . I want to share my experiences . About a year or a year and a half ago , i bought a set of knives from a television ad , assuming that they are better than my regular knives . Although , they were being advertised like even having the ability to cut a wood , it was a total disappointment when i got them . They were not even different from my old knives , and supposed to do the same job . Afterall , i began to use them in any case and after 6 months or so , they began to not to be trenchant and had to throw all of them away . They neither cut a piece of wood , nor a tomato at the end . My second experience is about believing or assuming the ad products were better was about a doll for my cousin . She wanted the toy , that was sold in a store , and also advertised on the tvs . As a matter of fact i bought the toy to her and it had broken in few days , while she was playing with it . As a conclusion , however , in the past i used to believe that the advertisements make the product better , I learned that it is not a statement , applying to every case . after all these experiences , I learned to criticise more about the stuff that i am going to buy , and not pay attention to the advertisments . they are not that useful , as they are shown .
(GER,high) Frankly , as long as we will not develop little spaceships to fly around - which I do n't see happening within the next twenty years - I do n't think there will be fewer cars on this earth ever again . It is a proven fact that the amount of cars we use , and most of all the emissions those cars cause impose a big threat to our environment . And although there is a lot of misperception today I am sure that there will be a much higher concern about environmental issues in twenty years . But this is , what will mainly happen in industrial states . We should not forget about the devoloping countries that start to take off now . I personally hope that they will manage to thrive further on , and increase their economical potential as well as living standards . But this usually implies a technological advance . People in India , China and eventually Africa will need to get to work , will want to travel and will demand cars . Lots of them . Even if they do not reach western standards , where it is normal to keep a couple of cars per household , their mere number of inhabitants will boost car demand . I do think though , that in twenty years there will be a difference in how cars work . I am sure that environmental concerns will be high , that people will have seen the importance to get independend from fossile fuels , and that cars will be developed that need less energy and additionally run on electricity , solar batteries , hydrogen , water , biological waste - or some new idea . They will be cleaner , more efficient and probably even run silently . There might also be an attempt to foster alternative means of transportation , like public means , bikes or trains . But this developement I rather see in industrial states . To put things in a nutshell , I think that in industrial states there will be less as well as cleaner cars . While developing states catch up there will be a much higher demand for cars , and also the necessary wealth to purchase them . This , I think , leaves us with an equal or rather higher amount of cars in twenty years , than we have today . I do hope though , that there will be better and cleaner cars on the market than the ones we use today . And I also hope that people in todays developing countries will be able to move along and start with the new technologies , and are not turning into a huge graveyard for our old , polluting cars .
(TEL,high) In twenty years from now , there is a high possibility that there will be an increase in the number of cars in use than there are today . The car even though was considered a luxury item earlier , has now become household . The main reasons that can be cited are the average per capita has been on an increase over the past few years . The people from the middle class families are growing richer and many of these families are of the opinion that there many uses of buying a car . The average cost of a journey comes to very less when the entire family goes on a trip . Instead of going and hiring cars or waiting in the queue to get the seats reserved in trains and which some times may go invain , owning a car is much better option . The prices of the cars had also dropped to a large extent attracting the people even from normal qualities to buy a car . Now a days most of the cars can also be made to run on natural gas which also saves lots of money on travelling . In addition to all these the cars also provide employment to many people and as the population is evergrowing many people might show interest in driving taxis for their livelihood . The cars can come very handy when both the husband and wife are working in near by places when one can drop the other on their way towards their office and dropping their children on their way to schools . There has been also been an observed decrease in the cars causing pollution to environment with the improved technologies such as zero engine noises that reduces sound pollution many a times . In addition to it the use of alternate sources of fuel has brought down the environmental pollution . Thus not causing any threat to environment . Also the chance of getting injured during accidents are comparatively less while driving cars when compared with two wheelers owing to the fact that they have safety belts and are protected from all sides . thus car provides a much safer travel . Now a days cars are coming in new designs and are also becoming easier to handle and are coming with such sophistications that many get attracted to . The reduction in pollution and new models of cars coming everyday with ultimate satisfaction to customers and the costs also getting lowered and the growth of the percapita income will mainly cause an increase in the usage of cars in the coming twenty years
(ARA,medium) nowadays the technology advanced and still advancing huge steps . this is true in every field of human life and human interest , specifically the media . also it is obvious the tight relationship between medias and advertisement . since no one can fight a today war by a yesterday arms , the advertisement introduced himself in every single field of our normal life , going from education to food etc . advertisement also has a primordial role in publishing and presenting any new isuue to the society . in order to succeed his mission the advertiser has to sell his product , means he has to present to the the public , to challenge other products and to prove the new product the best and more efficient one in answering the consumer 's needs , here is the tie and here lurcks the danger . the product needs two things to succeed . at first it needs the advertisement to present itself to others , otherwise nobody will be able to hear or now about it , a good example is a heeling herb in an isolated country . nobody can get its benefit other than the population of this country unless it has the advertisement it needs . and the other essential thing is the quality . because it doesn not matter how big the advertisement is , finally people will discover the truth and if this product or the fact that this advertisement is telling about is not good or not true the results will be opposite . here the tobaco can be an example . at first advertisement presented tobaco like a heaven vessels , able to bring them all the benefits and pleasures , but finally this advertisement was opposed and faced by studies and medical researches that proved this counterfactual stereotype . in summ , i would say that always the best way is the direct way . meaning the honesty which does n't deny the role of a honest advertisement .
(FRE,medium) Nowadays it is quite difficult to answer such a question as we all live in very hard times . First of all , i would say that , as being a young person , it is quite more easy for us to enjoy life as nowadays everything is possible . Our grand fathers had not even the half of what we have today , meaning that the range of possibilities have largened . It is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fighting at war . several times my own grandfather told me this so i would realise the chance we have . Secondly , i think this is so not to compare as we have totally other leisure times because of our age . By this , i mean that for instance , a younger one will enjoy doing a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someone older wo n't enjoy it as it means to much trouble and moving all the time . Also it is not true to state that we , being younger , enjoy life more than elderly people as we do n't have the same meaning of enjoying life . For me it could be reading books while for another it would be boring to do so . This means the same for elderly people . However , if it is a question of travelling a whole year long or to practice some extreme sports , it is true that we take more advantages of life than anyone else whose working hard to raise a family . So i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedule you have . If you are someone who has plenty of time to do all the things you like instead of having to earn money to survive , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyone else . But it is not a matter of age . In conclusion , i would say that i do not agree with the statement above . It is not a because you are younger than someome that it is obvious you are enjoying life far more . It is a question on how you oragise your time and with who .
(KOR,high) Some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . However , in my opinion , traveling alone is a better idea . Because I can manage my time by myself and save money . First , I do not want to be controlled my traveling schdule by other people . By traveling alone , I can make my own time schedule for my plan . For example , last year , I went to Paris in a group led by a tour guide . First time , I thought it was the best choice for me because I did n't need to book tickets , check the time and look for locations by a map . But after a few days . I realized that I was not the person who just like to follow other people and schedule led by a tour guide . I really wanted to see paintings more in Ruvere museum , since there were my favorite master piece such as Monarisa . But a tour guide did n't want to spent much time at there . She guided the master peice and gave me only 10 minute . I was so upset and embrassed , as I always eagered to see the work . After the travel , I decided not to go traveling in a group led by a tour guide . In addition , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more expensive that traveiling alone . I compared two cases by a calculate and found that traveling alone is a cheaper choice . I traveled around Spain two months ago by myself , then made a chart of spending money . I figured out that by traveling alone I could save more than three hundreds dollars compare to traveling in a group led by a tour guide with the same situation such as traveling same days and visiting same places . If I travel with them , I have to pay for a tour guide and the travel agency . In conclusion , I firmly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best idea . If I have a chance to choose traveling in a group or not , I will choose the last one . As I can controll my plan and my habits and save money .
(ARA,medium) I agree saying that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Why is this statement true in my opinion ? First of all , its not good enough to know how to do well something without improving cause i 'll be a habit a tradition and its something i 'm used to do so a little bit meaningless : Doing the same sport exercise everyday is good but when i start to make my body stronger and more efficace in movements i thing its successful . Secondly , life will be boring when i practice and live every single day the same way , with the same people , same place same time the same actions all time in all my life , nothong new nothong successful . At last , the most important thing in lifei think when i qualify to qualify an action , an accomplishment , something done , successful , it has to be a new thing i have passed because in general in life a human being have to always improve in order to live and think better in society : For example when accomplish a mission or a work habitually done , there 's nothing successful in it , but when i create a new way of working or i invent something new , thats what i call successful ! To cunclude i think life become boring , meaningless , unsuccessful when a human being live all his life without improving . successgul is a someone who tries new thing and takes riks
(ITA,high) The speed and the pace by which technology proceeds is very fast :: if we look at the past , we can recognize how human progress and inventions have changed and restricted their own time of preparation and creation . A set of materials in which man has improved his conditions of life is transport . Nowadays it 's very common to own a car and to get a licence to drve it as soon as possible . This means of transport has become essential to us . This leads me to openly state thet I do n't really think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . The following are my reasons to hold my opinion . Firstly , it 's commonly known that the number of cars owned by families has been strongly increasing in the last years : more and more cars are daily being purchased by people , and a clear proof of it is that centers that are specifically built to gather old and over used cars are overcrowded . Besides , it 's becoming more and more difficult to find a bare parking in the neighborhood of your house , expecially if you live in a city . Secondly , although the fuel ' and gas ' resourses are being strongly decreasing and scientific research is trying to find alternative ways to satisfy the huge supply for fuel , statisics in the market can ensure us that cars will constitute a well built buisness for still many years , no matter with what is concerning with fuel 's lack . Thirdly , techology works very fast , but not so fast to completely revolutionate our way of move and carry within twenty years : flying cars that we often see in fantasy-scientific movies are enough far from us . It 's true that many other ways of transport have been invented ( such as airplanes ) , but cars , buses and vans are too important to us , because they work on the ground ane we live on the ground , too .
(CHI,medium) In the morden society , lots of people use the spare time to travel around . And someone would like to travel in a group led by a tour guide , others apparently opposite , they want to trip alone or just with families , friends . It 's an universal argument in the long term . To my extend , I prefer to agree that the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide . In the first place , the consipicuous reason is that the tour guide is the one who is professional on tripping , and they familiar with the resorts or parks we traveling to . So he/she will give everyone in the group the introduction of the place they visiting , like the background , history , meaning and so on . Take the Great Wall in China for the instance , if there is no tour guide foreigners can not get the original of it and can not understand it 's functions . In their eyes , the wall is same with common , combined with bricks . In the second place , why I consider travel in a group led by a tour guide is neccessary is that the tour guide always to be there , so they are familar with the places ' tickets or some other expendings . They will tell the travellers which one is cheap or which one is not worth to buy . It 's really an effective way to save money , also , seldom be cheated . Furthermore , tour guide will arrange the schedule of all the trip . They will list the time sheet resonablely to show the travellers . Then travellers could make clear sense their sequence and will not waste any time of the vacation . As far as I concerned , this is very important factor we should considered before we begin the trip , because of our limited time . Admittedly , travel in a group have some disadvantages , such as , we constrict by the schedule of the tour guide ; it 's so tired to visite so many places , some of them we did n't want to , in a tight time ; it 's not comfortable to travel with many stranges . Albeit , everything could not be perfect , some time we have to sacrifice a little suitables . To sum up , take into all factors I outlined above , we can draw the conclusion that even though there are some uncomfortable things if we travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can get a lot from the trip under the led by tour guide . So again , I want to restate my inclination that I deem travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best way .
(CHI,low) travel Some people think the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide , if you want tarve is in agroup let , some poeople travel very quickly , and they think the road is very well . and choose about what it is right , and drive it very quickly , and they think it is very weel , by quickly and they like it . Also the accend happed by people drink some thing and drive car . , and abut tarrivel it is important some times many people i did n't carefull . , they are travel very quickly , and they did n't carefully about it , in some wite road some peple fell very well , and drive it very quickly , but also in some bad road , some people by car is very carefully and in this road the accident happend it very less , so i think the trivel by myself , an many accident happend it is about many people did n't be careful
(SPA,medium) In my opinion , it is more important for students to undersantd ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts . There are several reasons why I agree with this statement . First , I think that understanding an idea and a concepts is the first step to learn something new . For example , if you do not know the concept of `` evaporation '' how are you going to know the `` process of raining '' or maybe understand some chemical procress that involve the concept `` evaporation '' . Secondly , I agree that student must know every concepts of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challegens without knowing the fact . For example , if a student know the concept of `` bowling something '' , them it is would be easier for he to cook something by just following the instruction . Finally , I support this thanks to a personal experience I had lived . Last year , whem I was in high school , I had to take a science test and I studied hard for it . Whem I started to asked it I stoped at the most important question and did not know how to answer it because of my lack of knowlegde in some sciencetific concepts . To sum up , I believe that students must focus on learning all the concepts the can and then worry on learning facts because everything goes steps by steps and the first step here to learn a new fact , is first getting the ideas and the concepts of every new words . Therefore , they would have the skills to learn more than students think they could do without knowning the concept .
(TEL,medium) In the above paragraph author states that succesful people are take more riscs rather than only doing what they allready know things are how to do well . How ever the successful people are innovate new things to develope the country more effectively , because they knows everything on perticular work in that time they need to spend some time for the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it , for thaat they are need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things . For example we take an eroplanes , an eroplanes are invented by wright brothors they very common people in the world , because they implemented an eroplanes by using a birds . one day they think that how the birds are flying in the air . In that time they got one idea , yhe birds are having wings . so it was flis in the air . The wright brothers are differently and takes more risks to implement an eroplane . Therefore what i am telling that the people who are thinking diferently from what they already known . If they are thinking similarly about the work . They do n't get any new ideas and they are not succeeded in that perticular work . I conclude that the succeeded people who allready knows the work how to do well in that time also they having a chance to implement the new thigs , but they are not thinking in a broader way . the sucesfu l people are allways trying to implement new things , because they allready knows how to do the work . To implement new things it takes more time and enthusiausm to learn the work then only they are didicated to implement the new things .
(FRE,medium) How to be a creative person ? It is really tough to answer to it since everybody knows that the result of any creation has to be appreciated and approuved by other peolpe . Therefore , it does not only depends on our personal feeling . Well , it is not a good raison of evoiding to try new things instead of keeping doing well what we already know how to do . In the following paragraph , I am going to give illustrate and give arguments according to my point of view . With the evolution of new technology and the growth of the global market , competitions between people and other entities are increasing . Hence the need of releasing new things in order to remain in fashion or be more competitive . All this can happen only by trying new things . What the domain of competency , you would need to put in place new attractive things . As illustration , let 's talk about cellphones . Mobile phones companies allways release new type of device , and this just because they have try new technology instead of doing or trading the same model . Futhermore , if go back in the past , we will realize that all discoveries made by scientists , physicians , biologists and so on , have been possible because they haved tryed new things , new concepts , new experiences . All can see the result today : we hace electricity , cars , aircrafts , tablets and medecins , water and so on . All that make our today 's life , better to live . Therefore , I encourage people , whatever their social life , their occupation and their personality , to take a risk and try new things . This can contribute to the development our world and their own partuculary . We can not stay in the same way , for all our time we are going to spend on this earth , with taking any risk by putting in place new things . We just need to try , and one day we will get a good result .
(ARA,medium) Having a successful career is what everyone dream and work hard to achieve . When a people reache their goal they tend to be more protective about any descions that might not work well with them and causes them to loose everything they worked hard to obtain . Though , the term `` risk takers '' has grown popular these days , I have to admite my disagreement about it . Taking risks is a huge thing to do , it 's an act that you must think about very well before going through with it . Any successful person at some point will admit that having a safe garintade lifr is better than living a life depends on taking risks . My uncle is well-known business man in Saudi Arabia . He is so smart and successful . People actually used to say about him that everything he touchs turn it to gold . My uncle was not known for taking any risks when it comes to his money . However , when the stock market was first introduced and many people started to gain a good profit out of it ; he decided to give the stock market a try . He put alot of money into it . At the beginning his money doubled and than after a brief while the stock market went down . He ended up loosing all of what he has put there . Eversince , the only thing we hear from him is `` risks , never again '' . Life has changed nowdays . Everything has grown so expensive and the standard of living has definatly grow high . Offering a good , comfortable and garintade future is the best way to live . If your income will offer you that than why change and take riske that might end the future you have planed for you and your family . You never know what might happen tomorrow . Perhaps this is why successful people do not tend to take risks and try new things that basicly depends on pure luck .
(TUR,medium) There is a belief that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I am not quite agree with this opinion . I think older people enjoy life more . There are may reasons behind these . Firstly , older people have more money to spend . Usually people save money while they are younger in order live in prosperity when they get older and retire . But the youngers have to spend money to buy a house , to get their children educated well and things like that which older people have already taken care . This is why I stated at the beginning of the paragraph that older people have more money to spend . Secondly , older people do n't have responsibilities as much as youngers have . They have finalized all of their responsibilities like raising kids and working hard for a good career . Less responsibilities not only mean more time to spent for enjoyment but also it means less stress . I think everyone will agree that a person with less stress could enjoy life more . Finally , and most importantly in my opinion older people knows the value of every minute they spent and tend to look life in a more positive perspective . I want to give my grandfather as an example of that . He always advise me not to worry about the bad things , he says instead think things which are positive . There is also a proverb in Turkey about this , which is always think about the full part of the glass while you take a glass half filled . In conclusion I think older people benefits from the enjoyments in life much more than the younger people like me do and they deserve it .
(KOR,medium) Most of people love cars and want cars . Buying a new fency car is a dream to billions of people who do not have a car . The quantity of the car will increase continuosly in several decades . Because of cheap car , developing country and desire of people increase the number of cars . First , our car technology is advanced rapidly past several years , and it makes car cheaper . It is hard to imagine to own the car in 70's for non-rich family . My father told that there are fewer than one hundred cars in oursity when he was young . So he did not think about having the car , but he has one now . Because of the cheap car , cars will increase in twenty years than there are today . Second , there are hundreds of developing country and undeveloped country . These countries will develop like other countries someday , The similarity of the developing country is growing of the car population . In 1950's Korea was one of the poor countries in the world because of the Korean war . But , after America 's assistance Korea became modern country in 30years . In 1950's only few foriegner owned the car . But after 30years every single family had car . Last , the desire of people will increase the car population . Most of men wants to buy a car if they had a lot of money . In fact , most of rich people has more than two cars . And people like them are increasing too . When I saw the TV , there are a rich person who has 70 cars in his home . It was hard to belive , but the show says that there are millions of people who have cars more than ten and it will increase . In conclusion , it is obvious that too many cars can cause air pollutions , traffic jams and more car accidents . But these reasons actually can not stop the growing car population .
(JPN,medium) I disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are three reasons . First , older people have much time than young people because after older people retired thier jobs , they can enjoy the second life slowly . When they were working , they were so busy that they could not do what they want to . Besides , they could not take many vacations . They can do things which they could not do when they were working because they have a lot of time . However , young people do n't have a lot of time . They have to go to school or work . Students have exams . They are recqired to study harder and harder for exams . Second , they have more money than young people . When they were working , they would save money for their future . They can buy what they want , go where they want to and eat what they want to . Finally , of course older people have experienced a lot of things . They know what they should do when a problem happens . They also know how to avoid a problem . They would experience hard things that as if it seemed that they could not solve the problem , but young people have not experienced such a thing yet . Even if young people have experienced such a thing , the number would much less than those of older people .
(ARA,medium) will some times i do some times i dont . And it depends on where is the persones from . 1 : The young people : the young people can do alot of sports with out giting taird . they can do alot of things drive cars anything . Will where iam from being young is more fun than being old . U can do what evre u want u go to the beach aftter go to partes drive cool cars like BMW , LAMBERGENE , PORCH , CORVAT and more so here alot of the young people enjoy life more than the old people . 2 : The old people : will the old people like from age 40-50 have nice cars like : BENTLY , RR , MAYBACH and more ... some of them do some sports go out have alot of money and things but from age 60 and so on they just sit in the house watch tv or do something in the house if he wants to go some where it will be to his frinds place or go to a restront or something so its boring . Also where iam from the dads do evre thing to there sons like let them get married buy them cars evre thing and the son is like between 20-25 years old so he is so young and have so many good things . The point iam trying to say is that the young people have much more fun than the older people where i come from . but lets say another country for example ( LONDON ) : There i see the old people have more fun than the young ones not all but in genral u dont see a young one with a cool car like a BMW or so and u dont see a young one in a fanse restrant u only see old people going to fanse restrants , cool cars , and things so i say in a contry like that the old people have more fun than the young ones .
(ITA,medium) I think that young people nowadays are more interested in building their future they have less interest in doing services for their city or for their family . Nowadays the world is getting very little , young people can travel around the world faster than the precedent generations , they recive informations faster because they can use computers internet , and the television . They are more interested in the facts that happen in other cities or also in other countries , they don not solve the problems that their comunities have because they think that they are less important than the other just because they are getting addicted and used to them . They hear about the problems of their comunities everyday for that they need to listen to some news , somethig differet , and not the rutine that everyday live . I don not mean that should happen somethig of trerrible in their comunities in order to make them know about the problems of their comunities , but relatives , parents and friends , better if older than them , should make them know , first , about of the problems thar are closer to them in order to impruve the future generations 's and their way of living . They should understand that they cannot solve the problems of the world like the wars or the hungry in Africa but they should help first their communities . I cannot understand the people who leave their country in order to solve problems in an othet , when their country is going bad maybe for stupid things . In Italy is very commun this kind of behaviour : Italian people and above all italy its-self have a lot of problems , they think that they are a reach and modern country , infact the italian govern has muved his army in order to help others , they sacrificated a lot of young people to help other countries and not to help theirs .
(ARA,medium) This statement is true and false at the same time . First of all , young people are interested in their own life and how to make it better for them . For instance , a high school graduate will focus on attending college and afterwards taking a job and make a family . He wo n't care about a social problems in his society and will say : `` I must focus on my own life . I do n't have time for these things '' . Second , In most of young people , they tend to have fun instead of working very hard . To illustrate , A high-school student who get a summer holiday will think primarily about how to make it enjoyable . He thinks about travelling abroad or going to beach . He wo n't usually think about giving some of his allowance to a charity organization . But , However , it does n't apply for each individual person or community . Nowadays , a lot of youths support charity organization . For example , In Saudi Arabia , a lot of youths support the charity organizations with money . Thus , satisfying the demands of poor families in Saudi Arabia . Another example is , in Ramadan ( The season of fasting for Saudis ) , there are a lot of youths providing dates and water to the drivers in the traffic signs in order to break their fast . In conclusion , generally speaking , this statement is true although it cannot be applied on each individual young person .
(TUR,medium) I disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of some reasons . My some of the reasons to disagree that idea are ; first of all enjoying life does not connected to age completely , secondly when years are passed people get more experinced and finally older people understand life better than younger ones which help them to enjoy more . To begin with , lets try to define ` enjoying` . Is enjoying related to your phsical situation ? what i think is that enjoying is having fun and being happy in a certain time period which is not dependent to your phsical situation but your mental property . you can be very healthy about your muscles , organs and all your body but it doesnt mean anything if your mental condition is alright . Additionally , experience is very important in life to enjoy it . A famous singer says ` i know what it is to be young but you dont know what it is to be old ' when he reached the considerably old ages . People who lived a lot of things - which can be consired as ` taste ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happenings and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situations . Finally , life is not very easy to understand and identify . Every second passed through our life helps us to achive the understanding of the aim and that identification of life . This identification helps people to enjoy since the unavoidable end of this life is to ` die ' . Young people live as if they will never die whereas olders see that end easier than the youth that philosophical finish . Hence , i dont believe the idea that older people enjoy life less than the younger people do because i think it doesnt completely dependent on age and the reasons i mentioned above . I see a lot of young people never enjoy whereas a lot of very old people smiling and having fun with their friends .
(HIN,high) I do certainly believe that there has been a marked shift from the past in the attitude of young people with respect to their community . Though it will be unfair to generalize this to all young people , but most of the young people today show little concern for their community they live and dwell in . The younger generation today is much more concerned about their own future and well being and in this pursuit , they sometimes tend to neglect their communities completely or are just not able to afford much more time for it . They do not shy away from exploiting the resources of their community to climb up the ladder of their own success . In my day to day experiences , I have seen teens and students just littering away the wastes in the premises they live in . They sometimes tend to scratch and damage the property which is there for evryone to use . I am not sure what pleasure do these people derive by doing such activities but the fact of the matter is that they usually do it . If they can not help the community atleast they should not damage it further . To quote a personal experience , there was a friend of mine who was being offered the post of district magistrate of the town he has lived in from his birth . He did all his schooling from that town . He was a bright student and that is why he was able to get the post of district magistrate . He always used to carp about lack of infrastructure of the town like frequent power resources , insufficient water supply etc . Thus , he was never satisfied with the authorities . But he himself got the post and got the opportunity to do something for the community , he just declined the job for a more lucrative job offer abroad . Thus , when the actual time came to perform duties towards his community , he didnt take up the responsibilty . This goes onto explain that young people usually d not give enough attention and help to their own community . But , as I said before , this pattern cannot be generalized to whole lot of younger generation . I believe that the success stories of people who do give help to their community will inspire those who shy away .
(ARA,medium) Iam going to writing about the specifis peaple whom love to try a new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . In my opinen , i agree with this people becouse many reson . first , this people love to do this they are likey becouse they gave themself the chance to be better and to know more and more about every things they know it . also , i think this people never felling pooring becouse all the time they have same things to do it and enjoy . i think when you doing same things new and it is going write you fell great . Second , this people help the economic in thier country and ther is a big example for that china all the time the people from china doing anew things in the computer . another example , united states now the power country in all the world , they doing that by the people have a good things and by the people how to make every things good . also the english langauge how is come the first language in all the world by the book , work and every poor things in english Third , if you gave yourself the time to think about same thing new and same thing noy usually you will not just help your country but you also help yourself to know more and more about things you can do it and done . also , one day maybe what you think about in miunte be the most important things in the life , the people remmber you by this work after you die your name will be there In conclusion , i think it really important to things about new things and you have to be faster becouse the one how come first always better and remmber you can be a really good person with a really good things . any one can doing areally good thing if the things one munite maybe not a big things maybe it is small but i believe you can to do it just start to think .
(TUR,high) The Number of Cars in 20 Years Cars have been one of the most impressive invents of last centuries . However , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Declining oil reserves and oil prices and the increasing level of traffic in the cities will decrease the amount of cars in use . People will use public transportation instead of their cars . Oil prices have increased dramatically since the invent of cars and other vehicles using it . The amount of oil in the world is limited but on the other side the need for oil is increasing . Although the new explorations of oil fields can contribute to get additional reserves , the need for oil is increasing more rapidly than the explorations . With the increasing cost of drilling oil by these exploration the price of oil get higher day by day . The cost of driving a car is really becoming a big burden for family and country budgets . By the increasing number of cars , the traffic in the cities becomes untolerable , people start to complain frequently about the the traffic jam they are experiencing . You are buying cars and spending huge amount of money , but all you experience is getting tired in traffic . Public transportation is improving . The comfortable subways and nicely organized services will persuade the car owners to get rid of their cars . They will save money and avoid driving in traffic jam . People will leave their cars and the number of cars in use will decline in twenty years . Considering the oil reserves and oil prices and the crowded traffic , they will substitute to public transportation for the sake of saving money and not affecting by the traffic .
(ITA,medium) In my opinion , what expressed in the statement is not completelly true . I think that the fact that for a student , ideas or concept are more important than to learn facts , depends on the different attitude the student has . In my opinion by the way , it 's really more important to understand ideas and concepts behind a fact . The best example i can use to add value to my assumption , is my own experience during the university study . I 've studied engeneering and for most of the exams i did , to understand concepts was the most important aspect of the studying . Without that it would have been very difficult to pass the exam . Because you need that to approach to a brand new problem , that you have not seen before . I can study the fact that a construction can collapse if some project aspect are not respected and i can learn this facts . But if I do n't understand the concept or ideas behind structure 's Phisics I could hardly been able to project it properly . On the other hand It is obvious that for someone else results are more imoportant than the cause that has produced them , and therefor for those student , facts should definitely be more important than the ideas behind them . I 'm reffering for example to those students interested to history subject . Those students are mainly interested in facts that are the basis of their study field . But even for them I think schould be important to know and to understand what was behind a specific period or event . to better rember what happened due to a logical cause-effect process .
(TUR,high) The purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy a specific product . The business world especially marketers thinks that it does not really necessary to tell the truth , if you could sell something . First of all , advertisements are one of the most important tools of marketing . Their first and for most purpose is to attract people and persuade them to buy . The goal of advertisements is not to tell the truth . They can tell to truth but it does not mean that it is not just a way of marketing . It is still tring to convince people to prefer particular thing to others . People usually buy things which they saw on advertisements , and usually they get disappointed with the result . Even though people think that they are buying the same thing , the reality is that the product is always exegirated in advertisements and it will be worse than people thought . The basic example for this will be hamburgers . When I go to a fast food restaurant , I saw lots of pictures of hamburgers , and they look really big . When I buy one , I always find it to small to saticify , because the pictures convince me that they will be really big . However , one of the easiest way of getting information about a product is advertisements . Before buying something people want to learn more about it . They do not want to buy which they really do not need . People see advertisements in everywhere so they do not have to spend too much effort to obtain an information . Altough advertisements are the easiest way to learn something about a product to make a desicion , people should reconsider every detail that they heared from or saw on an advertisement if it can be true or not . They should be aware of the reality that the ads are for convincing people , not for telling the truth .
(ARA,medium) It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one spesific subject for many reasons . people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject are more like to be intellegent , beside they may get a lot of money apsed on the information and the experment they have . There are many reasons , that i can divide , why people prefer to have knowledge of many subjects . The most important reason , why people prefer to have abroad knowledge of many academic subjects , is that they want to have a lot of information which can give them a big apontunity to work with a big famous company . A good example of those people is my brother . He chose to to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Now , he is one of the biggest businessmen in the world . Beside , he has more than three civil engeneering companies located in all over the world . The secound reason reason is to gain alot of money . people spend all thier lives working in a smal companies with smal salary trying to get money in order to educate their children and to pay for the house rent and the bills . but when you get broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will be able to work in a big company with a huge payment , and you willl find diffrent jobs . In conclusion , i agre

(JPN,high) Recently , there have been discussions about whether it is better to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts . While some people think it is important for them to learn facts , I would think that it is crucial for them to understand ideas and concepts . First , I think understanding of certain ideas and concepts will be applicable to various fields . When I was in a universtiy , I used to study marketing in my seminar . While I have forgotten most of facts what I have leared through the seminar , there is one thing that I still have not forgot and will be advantageous throughout my life . It is the phrase , `` What is important is methodology of thinking , but not the knowledge '' from my professor . He taught me the importance of the phrase through the seminar . He often explained that in a certain sense , marketing is a methodology of how to attain one 's aim . When a certain company decides its corporate strategy , it should analyze its competitiors , macro environment and resources of own company . Taking all those factors into account , a company should decide its strategy . He added that this methodology , or way of thinking , is always applicable to many different fields . I completely idea with the idea . I consider that the way of thinking is essential in terms of achieving goal even at an individual level and I always practice in my work , while I am now working for a financial company . Second , under a rapidly changing environment , I consider that facts will become obsolete so fast . I work as a fund manager in London , analyzing Japanese companies . In my work , I have a number of opportunities to talk with managements and corporate directors from companies , where I learn precious information every time I have meetings with them . Although what I have to point out is that those `` facts '' which I learn are no longer beneficial for me just couple of months later . This is because market environment surrounding companies changes dramatically in very short time , thus the companies ' strategies will subsequently have to be adapted . Therefore , the facts once used to be brand new will be no longer valid in three months time . Given the facts , I normally try to ask companies of thier thoughts and ideas underlying certain strategies they implement . This will make me project what kind of strategies they will make when environment changes . In conclusion , as understanding of concepts and ideas can be applicable to various fields , while facts will become old in relatively short period of time , I would definitely argue that the former is more critical than the latter .
(TUR,low) I do n't agree it is better to have board knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize one spesific subject because being specialize in many academic subjects means your attention divides to many academic subjects . If everyone does just his or her work well then every work would have a specialized person . Being specialize in many subjects means your brain and your attention divides many adacemis subjects . Its harder to focus a lot of points than focus just one point . For example the students studying double major in universty and they have two exams for next day . They have to study both . Then they can not study as much as their other friends . If they have enough potential to get good grades from both think about to they study just one exam . Specializeing one spesific subject is means you have enough time and enrgy to study about the think whick you are working on . But if you are triynig to study more than one spesific subject then you do n't have enough time to specialize as much as the ones who specializes one spesific subject . I think if every one does just their work well the world would be a better place to live . Think about a person who is a engineer can he or she make a better construction than an architect . No . But also an architect can not do the thinks as good as the engineer does . World has a rule and everyone has to do his or her own work and have to try to be specialize his or her own work . Being specialized in a subject is allways better than being specialize in many subject because the one who specialized in many subject can not know as much as the think that the one who is specialized just one subject .
(ITA,high) I do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . It can be very convenient , of course : for example you do n't have to think about anything ( for instance car hiring , hotels , restaurants , museum tickets ... ) ; you simply sit down in the bus and enjoy the trip . Furthermore , the guide is supposed to know everything about the places you visit and so she ( or he ) can tell you interesting stories about , as well . At the same time , though , travelling in a group led by a guide has a lot of disadvantages that , according to me , are not worthy . First of all , you have to respect a strict and not flexible timetable ; you ca n't choose what you want to visit or where you want to eat , for example . Usually during tours there are thousands of things to do ( and some of them pretty awkward ) so you do n't have enough time to enjoy the places you see along the way ; in many cases you have just the time to get off the bus , take a picture and go back to the bus again . Then , having to follow this strict plan , you ca n't ask to stop when you see something you think is really nice , even to take a picture . And , above all , you can stop to go to the toilet just when the plan tells that you are allowed to ! Sometimes you are obliged to do things you do n't like , as well . For example climbing a mountain even if you are afraid of it or sleeping in a camping where there is no water at all , except for a river in which `` friendly '' crocodiles live . Last , but not least , you never know people you will travel with : if you are lucky they will be very nice and you could go on with them quite well . On the contrary , if you are not lucky , you could have to stand for some days ( or a couple of weeks , that is even worst ) the company of a group of people that you really dislike , very different from you , sometimes very boring , sometimes too excited . All these things considered , together with my personal experience , make me prefer a journey by myself or with some very reliable friends .
(ARA,medium) First , to decide wether or not to study a subject deeply , a decision for what a person want to be in the future must be answered carefully before . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is really essential for our daily life . People are created to learn lots of information on aregular basis in order to coupe with the enviroment in which he lives in , and a person which has no base of knowlege cannot survive within a society . For example how can a person explain to himself the idea of how the planets revolve around the sun or how the moon is able to rotate around the sun without losing its track ? Or how can the sun supply the high amount of energy needed to light the earth , without learning science ! Can you see , thats the diffrence between an adult and a baby . Being able to use all the academic knowlege accuired during our academic study is essenciall even in our work . But goin on with this idea people will spend a lot of time and effort only to accuire broad knowlege . While having a specific subject in which a person can specialize in is very important for his work . Trying too gain a deep knowlege about a subject is just great , cause why to study other subjects that you donot like and miss the knowlege that can be accuired on the subject that you are not intrested in . Now and by studing the subject you favour you can always gain lots of information as you wo n't be bored as this is the field of your intrest and you will keep on increasing your knowlege on and on . I really think that studing on a broad scale would be better as a person may have many fields of intrest , besides he would have knowlege in other fiels of study that may help in the field that he wants to specialize in as most of the studies that we learn are somehow linked together in a certain way or another .
(FRE,high) I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Our current academic system creates experts , encouraging specialization of students , orienting them into specialized domains : electronic engineers , modern litterature , Greek art , South American civilization ... Of course , the society needs experts and people able to answer specific questions , highly skilled people in order to make the science , the philosophy , the techniques , the whole society evolve and progress . However , I believe that in order to have a comprehensive and accurate vision of the society , the world , the past , the future and the present , one needs to have a broad knowledge of various academic topics . We should draw lessons from our ancestors who were philosophers , mathematicians , physicians , writers , politicians ... They were truly able to relate one field of activity to another and to use the knowledge of one field to progress in another one . Nowadays , researchers and scientists work on genetic manipulation . Intellectuals , philosophs , writers , discuss the scientific breakthrough from an ethical point of vue . Would this specific situation of a clear separation between the scientifical and the ethical could exist if our experts had a broader expertise ? I really think it is dangerous to specialize in only one field of activity because thus you miss a significant contribution from other fields . Besides , I think that it is important for the construction of one 's personality and to live in harmony with other people to be able to understand other people 's interests , to be able to question things , to be able to think ` outside the box ' ... With over-specialized people , are we heading towards a communitarian society in which scientists live and think with scientists , artists live and think with artists ?
(GER,high) I fully agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . In my mind advertisement is just the invention of some smart business managers who wanted to increase the money they make through the selling of their product . Of course advertisement is also a possibility for a company to present their product to a wide range of people through television . But I am of the opinion that , if they would tell the truth about their product less people would buy it . They have to make people believe that their product is the best product that they could buy , and that it would improve their lifes . I think especially products such as washing powder seem much better in the advertisement than they really are . Do we not all know the advertisement about the `` new incredible washing powder '' that is able to clean all our clothes and make them look brand new ? There are so many of the advertisements that claim that they have found the solution for our daily problems . Honestly , I have to say that none of these products ever worked as good as it should work . It is a well-known fact , that most of the people believe in the advertisements . The companies use the belief of the people that it is not allowed to lie . Everybody knows from his parents that it is not polite to lie and so the people think that the advertisement cannot be wrong . I also noticed that the people who produce these clips use the lack of knowledge of the people . In Germany there is a clip for yoghurt with sugar from fruits . For the people who do not know about fruit sugar , this yoghurt seems much healthier than a normal yoghurt does . A lot of parents want to give their children something healthy and therefore they buy this kind of yoghurt . If my mother has n't told me that fruit sugar is almost as unhealthy as normal sugar , I would also have believed that this product is much better . Especially this information from my mother made me believe that most of the products seem better in the advertisement than they really are .
(ARA,medium) Companies produce their products to sell them to the people . Sometimes , thses products need more appereance to make the people know about this product . Advertisements are the most poluler things in this time which many has existed and they need to advertise their product . However , some companies produce their product in the honest way . As an example , some of these companies have been producing an effeicient thing for the people , these companise do not ness to appear by an exellent look because ecerybody knows about this company . On other hand , some companies are not good as other companies that make the same proucts . Advertisements sometimes make their product appear as an imagination product . For instance , some companies make their product very enffiencient and good product . These advertisements make the custmore becareless of wisting his money and buy this product without pay attintion for the disadvantige of this product . This things make the customer be aware to buy another product whether than from this company or others . However , sometimes these advertisements make the customer see the advantage of this product which it is very helpful for the people to be get that product as soon as possible to receive that product and it make you feel better to buy an insurance for your things that you bought from them . It is really depend on you , if you want to conifrem that you got the right product you should ask the people that surruonded of you and may be the people who bought that product . Adverisments always have their effect of you if you did not pay attention for yourself . Do not buy the product without making sure that you got the right product . therefore , sometimes the advertisements serve only the people who work in that company . Also , it is your duty to give your opinion about this product to the people if you fell in that whole and extract them from wisting their money . Without a doubt , Advertisements always seem different than the real things . it appear as an increidable product but , in fact it is not . It might be sometimes good product but not always as the people respect from this product . It has a lot of disadvantage especially if is it a new product . Howecer , it is your response if
(CHI,medium) Which is more impoprtant for students ? Ideas and concepts , or facts . It is a controversial issue that whether students should understand ideas and concepts or directly learn from experiences . Depending on personal experiences , personality type and emotinal concern , different people may have different choices , because both sides have their advantages and disadvantages . Students may decide which way is better depending on what they are learning . Ideas and concepts are the base of any subjects . First of all , they summarized the thoery of one subject which make learning deeply possible . For instance , if you study math , you have to learn the formula , laws and rules first . Without these ideas and concepts , you could not resolve any mathmatical problems . Second , ideas and concepts make your study process more effective . In the progress of learning , you will know on what stage you are and what will be the next . Third , ideals and concepts can prove and examine what your studied . Take the same example of studing math , after you resolve a problem , you may use the math laws and formula to prove whether it is right or wrong . On the other hand , ideas may be boring , not as interesting as the visual effects . And facts are more real and convincing factors for the students to understand and remember what they learned . Let 's see the graduate students majoring in MBA , they learned many business terms and rules about competing , managemet and marketing , but they wll not really understand them unless they worked as a internship for a while in a company . So that , experiences are the best illustration and these facts are hand on experiences which will benefit you for the long time . From another view , sometimes the facts maybe not so typical to be a good statement of what you learned from concepts . For example , you were in a small poor company less of regulation and culture . In general , understand ideas and concepts and learn facts , both have their advantages and disavantages , we can not say which one is more important if we contemplate all these factors . From my poin tof view , the best way of learning is combine these two methods , because we can not get most effective result without any of them .
(JPN,medium) I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . There are two reasons to support my disagreement . First , the travel in a group is limitted for time . There are many people in group travel and it means it 's difficult to control . Thus group travels need to being scheduled exactly to control easier . If I find the nice place , where I want to stay and enjoy more time , I can not afford to stay there . Second , there is no dicision to where we go . tour guide also dicide the place to visit . Most of the visitting places are only famous sightseeing place . Of course It 's imprtant , I think . However if you want to learn and touch with local culture through travel , you should visit not famous place such as coutryside . When you go to contryside you may meet local people more and it provides the opprtunity to become friends . I think it 's really good souverior than ordinal one thar Becouse of these reasons , I disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
(HIN,medium) `` Need is the mother of invention '' When needs change the things which are commonplace today change like a dream . Alternative solutions are found with inventions . So though it may sound strange after looking into the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies , I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today . Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers . Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call . Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances . This things virtually eliminate the need to go out , drive and shop . With the advent of internet , it is very much possible to work from home . With the means like video conferencing the memebers in a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe . E-learning has opened new horizons . Classes and even archives are available online . These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest , reducing the need to go out everyday . Population is a huge problem faced by many countries as it is linked with the limited resources like land . It results into the heavy traffic seen on the roads . Most of the automobiles today run on petrolium products which are getting extinct . Also they depend on the political aspects like relations with some oil producing countries . We can have alternate solution for that like renewable energy like solar power but the effectiveness of it is still a doubt . With the steadily increasing standards of living across the globe and Government policies improving everywhere we will soon have a better and faster public transports which will reduce the need for having personal mode of transport . It may sound a distant dream now but we cant deny the possibility of everyone having a mini aircraft . It will make the cars a history . It sounds a fairy tale but so was the case when people talked of mobile communication before the invention of cellphones . You never know , need can create magic . So expect fewer cars on road in the coming years .
(FRE,low) I strongly support the statement . young people play life more than older people do , because of these reasons . First of all , young people hav n't any probleme ; for exemple when the sun arrive the young people go to play game . second of all , young people hav n't some one to do ; for exemple the day when they hav n't school , young people prefer to sleep long time or to look at tilevision and over . also , young people hav n't a responsability ; for exemple if they hav n't give the house propretor money heir mather or father wlould pay from him . In conclusion , older people cannot enjoy life like young people because they have a big responsability to do .
(ITA,medium) I think that the statement is correct ! In our consumistic society an object 's value is no more calculated by considering how much useful is or how good does its task ! Now for most of the goods have to be '' cool '' and have '' good looking '' . In order to increase the '' coolines '' of an object the producer spend a great amount of money in advertising and promotions ! In example Apple computer pay a fee to major of the cinema in order to make machintosh computer appear in movies ! If you pay attention in films you can quite only see mac ! An other exemple [ excuse me for speeking always about computers but I 'm studing computer science engeneering ... so I 'm a sort of computer geek ] again froma Apple is the '' look '' of macs ... the apple 's coputer lines have always an extremely cured design ! An other way to convice people of the '' cooliness '' of a product is to associate the product to famous people that are known being fashion ! '' Fashion '' ... this is a key word ! In our world in order to sell something you must get it become fashion ! Think about the iPod ... it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world ... and not for its technology ; it is famous due to the fact its design is '' cool '' ! So now having an iPod maks you a '' coolo '' person ! For the people of the 21st century being '' cool '' and fashion is the most important thing [ in particular for young people .. in fact for the beeing par of a group , and in particular the cool one , it what they aim for ] . Counting on the fact that most of people in the civilized world watch a minimum of 2 howr of television a day ... the best way to let products be known is through tv ! Not only by spots ... but also trough '' subliminal '' messagges ! This consumistic society want to keep us slave of : '' be cool or be nothing '' !
(HIN,high) `` You only live once , so live life to the fullest '' is a well known saying , echoed across cultures and countries all over the world . People are probably tired of hearing it . It basically means that everyone can enjoy life no matter how old or young they are . And they should . Because lost time wo n't be found again . If someone were to say to me that young people enjoy life more than older people , I 'd have to completely disagree . There are definitely big advantages being an older person . For one , you 'd probably have your own money to spend and I 'm pretty sure there 's no better feeling than earning your own bread and butter and then going about spending it . For example , there 's a strapping young 15 year old lad who likes nothing but to spend his day at the arcade and throw away all his allowance playing a pinball machine . Allowance . That 's all . Now let 's take the example of a millionaire who has n't managed to let go of his childish ways . He just bought an arcade ( and an amusement park ) and had a few pinball machines moved to his sprawling 12 bedroom , 14 bathroom mansion . Seems like these oldies have all the fun . Let 's take into account that in most countries you have be over 21 years of age to go bungee jumping . Not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n't be able to . Enter electronic media and technology . Ever so often we 're subjected to watching millionaires and billionaires on television . They always seem so happy . Sure they ca n't really ride a skateboard or a bike but they 've managed to replace that with a more than adequate automatic scooter that they just have to stand on . I can imagine them zipping around on their little scooter , looking at kids on skateboards and thinking that they 're having way more fun . In fact to some extent , I even think that older people are `` allowed '' to have more fun . Yes , it 's unfair . But such is life . It goes without saying that with age comes responsibility and I think a complete person is one who accepts his age and his responsibilities towards himself and the society he lives in . But that does n't mean the fun comes to an end . It almost never does . Bad health , beer bellies and balding are a few deterrents from that life of fun , fun , fun . But then again , you only live once and older people know that better than anyone . They 're trying to get as much in while they can . I ca n't wait for my days as an old man kicking back in a comfortable chair and watching soccer on the television . The fun never stops . Hey , look who just bought a yacht .
(SPA,medium) When we are at school most of the knowledge we absorve is from ideas and concepts , things that we commonly learn from our books , that are taught in classes but can not be understood from ourselves because we 've never experienced . That 's why sometimes ideas and concepts can be considered unrealistic , because they only work with and ideal background or enviorment . On the other hand facts are real , facts are things that use to happen and the difference with ideas is that sometimes the aplication them can not be easily put on practice . For example , at schools , we all learn about theories and formulas that were invented to use to resolve problems , and that 's what we do at schools , we make a simulation of some problems that can be resolved with those tools . But the the thing is that not everything in our life can be resolved by a formula , we wish it could happen that way as easy as it sounds but it 's not . The truth is that people sometimes learn from their mistakes from personal or professional experiences and those are examples of facts . The real knowledge you get , you learn it within the past of the time and that makes you wiser than other people . You get the respect from other people by what you know , and some of these things , are things you get by the experience or facts . I do n't think that ideas or concepts are unnecessarys for the students , this is also an important issue , but this es only the start . The learning experienced by ideas and concepts can not be very clear for the students because its something they have not lived with their own skin . Once students have the ability to get recognizing all these a put it in practice as a fact , they have a clear image of what this is talking about . Finally I would n't take the credit of any of both choices , because certainly concepts and facts go together , but for me I think that facts are what we are maid of , is what we see , what we touch or what had happened to us that make us stronger people , and make us take right decitions of a personal or profesional situation .
(TUR,high) Cars are indispensible for our lifes since they are used very commonly and since they facilitate our transportation to high extent . Even though this statement is a fact , some people still think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years time . What I think is just the opposite due to two reasons . The first reason is that the technology in twentieth century is improving very fastly that might lead to a decrease in the prices of cars . As most people experince from computer world , when something new is introduced into the market , the older one gets cheaper and more people can have the opportunity to buy the older one . I think same situation is also valid for cars . Since many companies are working on providing cars with superior qualities , the prices of some old cars , still with really good properties , will decline and therefore more people will be able to afford to buy a car . The second reason is that there are many research going on the development of alternative energy sources for transport other than petrolium , which might provide cheaper fuel for cars . As most of you know , nowadays many cars are run on natural gas instead of petrolium making the travel expenses much cheaper . This already lead to the increase in the use of cars as I observed . Since the fuel is becoming cheaper , people reluctant to buy cars since they do not want to pay huge amounts of money for driving will change their minds . Furthermore , some hopeful research is also going on about the use of hydrogen in transportation vehicles which might even further decrease the price of the fuel since it is really an abundant element in the world . In conclusion , due to some technological advances in car production market and hopeful research about alternative energy sources such as hydrogen for vehicles , which will lead a decline in the prices of both the cars and the fuel , people will tend to buy more cars in near future .
(CHI,high) Nowadays , people 's daily life are full of different kinds of information . And with the high-speed development of technology , the relation between different fields ' knowledge are much more closer . So if you want gain a successful career , you 'd better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Car industry set an goog example for my opinion . To make you company earn more profits , only imroving the technology is not enough . It is true that people prefer the car that has better quality , good design , and lower cost . And also technology can fulfill these target . But after you producing such a good car , the really more significant thing is how to sell it or how to occupy more market , which need the theory and knowledge of enterprise management . You should have a acute sense of what your potential consumer is need , what they think the car should be , and the most important factor that can determine how well your car 's selling is how much they can afford . Without all of these useful knowledge , I mean what in different fields , the company will lose their customer , then lose their market and finally close down . Service industry is another exaple that indicates what I have asserted . Many people think that the only skill that a waiter or some other people who provide service is being good at making their customers or clients feel comfortable and satisfied . However , it is not the case . The fact is these people also need some necessary knowledge to cater to different taste of different people . For instance , the receptionist who work in an international hotel . Firstly , they need know how to serve customers . They can learn from the books which contain different customer , different culture and suitable manners . They also should master at least foreign language to make they can communicate people who speak different language . If they can not , they may lose their job . According what I refered above , I can confidently draw the conclusion that have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not only make one 's life more colorful , but also make one much more competitive in today 's labor market .
(TUR,medium) I do not agree the statement that claims young people enjoy life more than older people do . We can not define certain parameters of joy in life . It depends from person to person , not with the time we spend in the earth . I think that the joy of life increases by time because we are given a chance to understand what 's going on in our life , getting familiar with so many aspects of it or even to get rid of some parameters of it , if we are lucky enough . An older person could possibly know what he or she wants in life and in my opinion , that kind of knowledge can be a relaxing issue and calling joy for that particular person accordingly . For example , we do not need to worry about our future and from now on everything could be our new way of fun . Moreover it is so possible to see and meet so sad and bad looking and miserable young people while comparing an energetic and smiling old people . The fear of future effects so much on the young people causing them to behave and live just not fitting with their potentials possibly and even some kinds of joys turning into an addict issue even if they are relatively too young such as drugs . As a conclusion I think that only being young can not give us the chance to enjoy life .
(CHI,high) I agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their communities . Considering too many entertainments in their environment and too many academic assignments in their school , and too less timie to rest , young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related tasks . First , it is too many attractive entertainments in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainments . For example , in my dewelling city , there are full of all kinds of entertainments , such as pub , movie theaters , and department stores . The young people spend their each weekend and holidays on shopping , seeing the movies , and playing . As a result , they have less willingness to devote to their communities . Second , it is a great number of school assignments that prevent young people from attending community affairs . Today , young students have more homework , assignments , and quizzes to complete than before . Because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information , young people are required to do more practice and take more examinations during their education , which reduce their possibility to join communities . Finally , it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affairs . For example , in my country , young students have to attend cram school after formal school classes . Also , they are expected to take various art or music classes only because their parents ask them to do so . In this case , they could n't have enough time to rest , not to mention that they plan to help their communities . In summary , I agree that today , young people give much less time to helping their communities for several reasons , which may be mentioned above , too many time on entertainments and school assignments and less time to rest .
(ARA,high) The issue of whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a controversial one . On the one hand , being young is attributed with enthusiasm and health which are both catalysts of enjoyment . On the other hand , the process of growing up undergoes many physical and mental changes which might alter the enjoyment of life . I personally believe that a smaller age has no influence on happiness due to many reasons . First , let me define young and old . Young is a person aged from 0-30 , while an older person is aged from 30 and more . According to my observations and to my personal experience , older people have the ability to enjoy their life better . One reason of my belief is that young people have not enough expertise in life to enjoy it the best . For instance , a 15 year old might feel frustrated because of peer pressure at school and he lacks the cognitive means and the maturity level to deal with his problem . A 35 year old man would know how to deal with his problem because he has enough experience in life and he has lived enough to pass through all kinds of the problems that youngsters suffer from . A second reason to my belief is that an older persons have access to the means of entertainment better than young persons . An adult is allowed to a night club , is allowed to drink , to get married , to have children , etc. while the young 's enjoyement of life might be controlled by his parents , his age , his external environement . Perhaps the most important reason to my belief is that adults are psychologically stable . Their physical and mental changes have already passed through all the intriguing stages that might cause frustration to youngsters . For example a 40 year older would maybe already be settled in a house with children , a fixed job and a routinic life . In contrast , a younger person would have to worry about highschool grades , college , love , settlement , money and many other issues that are of no certainty to the person . In conclusion , I would certainly feel that as we go with time we might enjoy life better since we are about to have a more secure way of living , less uncertainties and of course no more physical and mental changes to worry about .
(TEL,medium) I disagree with this statement to some extent . Young people are more enthusiastic for doing such type of work than the older ones since the latter have a family and also concentrate on their careers to support their family wher as young peole are at the start of their careers and they have less pressure . You can also take the example of many universities having community service as their course . in these courses although there are no grades they provide great pleasure for younger people to go outside the university and help a community . Also young people should not be expected of only doing community service since they have an important decisions to make regarding their career . One such experience to support the statement i have made is occured on the date which is celebrated as mahatma gandhi 's birthday . On that day many of my colleagues at a local call center and many other software professionals participated in helping out to clean a community nearby which is full of slums . the reward which we got for it is a great deal of happiness . From then on we helped out that community on saturdays of every week by conducting calsses on health and hygiene and even conducte the classes for elders who dont know how to read and write . For me this is a perfect example to show that younger generations can do such stuff in modern times too . You can also take the example crisis situations like during war time . Here young ones are the first to take responsibility in providing any kind of support the army or even helping out the injured . In summary people should not judge young people on just observing some section who are not that great at community work and also this judgemen
(ITA,medium) I agree with the statement above because I think that humanity in general has beneficiated from men willing to risk what they previously achieved in order to find something new or more valuable . If some scientists would n't have put under scrutiny the discovery of the past we probably would n't have increased our knowledge in medicine or science in general . When Galileo Galilei said that our planet hearth was round and not flat like everyone else was thinking had everything tho lose and in fact he had to retreat his affirmation in order to save his life from the accusition of heresy . If we would n't have question our knowledge we probably would n't have discovered all those things that we are taking now for granted . Even those things will probably came under scrutiny in a not long future giving us the chance to improve what we know or we think of knowing . The ability of putting ourself under judgment and been up for new challenges is a great gift . It 's never too late to learn something new and ampliate our knowledge . That it will only give us more as a person . We should never lose our curiosity of when we were child , our brain will never stop to learn if pushed in doing so . There is nothing wrong with failure as long as we are going to learn from our mistakes and put them into use for a successful purpose . That 's why
(ARA,medium) A wize mane wance said `` knowing a thing about every thing is better than knowing every thing about one thing '' , he said it once and i will allway will repate it , i see my self as a successful persone in my community because i allways try to learn more and more in my life even the unneccassery issue i would like to know even a littel about them . doing your job successfully is a good thing , but dowing more than one subject in a verey good way in better and more effective in your life. here is some benifits of having a several things that you can do corractlly : 1 - the abillity to work in more than one job . 2 - you will earn more mony . 3 - having a mind that is full of ambitions and attendans . imagin yourself btween a new groub of frinds or withe your frinds at work and a very exiting subject has been ocuerd and the others are talking about it while you dont know what thay are sayng !! that 's a scema i wolud not like to be in . in a higher level , lets say community aspects . in order to have a verey bounded and secure community it will be verey usfule if the partecepants ia this comunity know how to do more than one thing in there life 's . even in the sports field it will be better fore your body to experince more than one movment like hikking and swimming one is in the water and the othere is in the mountens but both are good and healthy even if its risky in a way or anothr but risk is the only attribute that makes this life more enjoyable and tastable . pepole live only one life - as far as i know - stoping yourself from doing any thing in your life in un questionable if you answer this question : How many times you will live ?
(HIN,low) I am agree with the point that the it important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the fact The main resion behind of is that if a student want to be last long good students then in that case he/she will has to learn the basic things behind , which will still with his for whole life and when ever in the life he will be needing it will be just recalled by him . Only those people can perform well in the platform of the life who was a good student in the past . What I think is that only knowing the fact is creating the shortcut to learn the things , ya it helps sometimes but not always that why it is very much nessary to learn the things by the understanding the ideas and the conceots . In future what will happen that if a student was not a good student in the early stages then in that case he would be also not a good teacher , i.e. he can not explain or transfer the fact to the others . And to support my openion I am taking my own example - When I was a student in the college ( Engineering college ) then in that case my favourite topic was the Explosive and rock type ( Mining Engineering topic ) . So , I took that topic with very much interest and the result is now I am getting today when I joined a company then it was a co-incident that i was putted in the drilling & blasting department and on the 14th day I had managed by owm a blast in that perticular mine . And very soon I got the authorisation of the blasting in that mines in the 6th month , which is record for that mine , which only my personal openion . So , here all credit will automatically go to those classes where I was provided the idea and the concept of the thing . So , I am thankful to my proffesor who tought me so well , and I would like to pray with the God to provide the professor of that kind to other students also . So , students should pay attention in the class .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement . But I do n't mean that young people are nowadays unkind but mean that they are looking at other place , not thier community . For example , many young people want to go overseas to help other people . It is a kind of trend among young people to participate in projects of NPO or other group doing volunteer activity . In actual , I saw many times the advertisment of such kind of projects , tours or distributions . Even though travel agencies offer those special tours that tie up with those activity group . So I can say that it 's very very common and popular to help poor people or distructed green . But I do n't think they are really serious about the comunity around them . Probably they do something for their commnunity , but will not give enough time to do that . There are two reason . The one is because of grobalization . We learn so many thing about other countries from many sources and some of young people can learn it directly . They could get to know the people in South Africa sufferd and hungered . These knowledge is enough for them to participate in the tour for delively foods and comodities for the people in South Africa . The another , is also related with that . Everything of other country is very different from things that they have . Food , custom and culture . These things are very interesting for young people , and it make them take to other countries . They can learn atractive and new things , and some of them are really abusoluted in things of other countries . Compared with things gs other contries , things around them is less atractive . So that 's why they are not very interested in their community .
(KOR,low) Did you understang everytime your learend everything ? This subjet is It is more important for students to understang ideas and concepts than it is for learn facts . In my opnion I prefer important for students to understang ideas and concepts . First , do n't worry by not your understanging fot study and understanding . every eachother have each opnion and think so we can not contorl their think and understanding , so we need to say our opnion and we need to know why ? and how ? and understanding . Second , we are different , every pepole is different , for example color , language , culture and custom so we ca n't understanding , i have experience , wheh i was came to first visit USA , i do n't know everything , and than i think if i eat good food and i give some food for my friend . i think he like this one , but suddenly hi throwout everything . so i 'm very surprise . and then he said me our country can not eat pork , i really mistake . so i understanding everyboby is different , and everytime nerver forget and think . Futhermore , thinks and behavior , and ues . If you learend something you can use good work , but you can also ues very bad work . for emample , someone theated something , but you can understanding different or mistake , you can use tealent for your bad way . this is very bad and sad . so we need to know good understanding . and thinking about possitive way .
(TUR,medium) In my opinion there are two types of students ; one is learning by searching the issues deeply and the others give up searching when they understood the ideas and concepts but it does not mean that to learn facts 's not important for students than understanding ideas and concepts . Trying to understand the fact behind the particular issue help students to get a wider view about that issue . This kind of behaviour also help students to learn questioning the reasons of events which are effecting whole lives of them . But on the other hand to give up following the facts can not help us respond the problems . By this way accepting the results becomes easier than solving the problems . I can easily assert that understanding of facts is as important as important understanding the ideas because by questioning the events understanding also becomes more easier . I mean that only understanding the concepts can not improve knowledge by itself also the importance of learning fact is great . So I can easily say that many times a student should want to learn the intuitions lies behind the concepts . It is like a sense of wonder and it is like a mean for development or improvement in life . Education system also has a great affect to make students notice the importance of learning facts or reasons during their education period . Because the strategy that they are taught in the school age will also effect the way of thinking during their lives . So an education system should teach students to search a concept or an idea before accepting the it directly . On the other hand it does not mean that understanding is not as important as learning fact . It 's like a chain and should follow each other . I mean that after understanding the concepts or ideas the other important process should be applied which is learning the intuition behind particular issue . Consequently I am not agree with the following statement that understand ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts for students . Process of learning facts is also very important for students . Such a kind of learning strategy can lead to success in many areas in their lives of students .
(ARA,high) where are you going grandpa ? shopping , golfing or maybe to a cruise on a yacht . That is what i usually get when i am really bored of studing or tired of endless working hours while my grandfather or even my father are getting ready to go on some sort of selfpleasing activity . I believe old people enjoy life more than youth or even teenagers do with all the study and work hours or the restrictions forced by parents . It is so hard for a young family member to enjoy life as much as elders do . As a begining , old people dont have any kind of study , midterms or finals to care about . They dont have to spend hours studing , going to school , attending classes or even buying books . They have alot of free time they can spend in any selfpleasing activity that brings happiness and joy to them . In addition to that most of old people do not have a job or a career to care about . Most of them are either business owners or unemployed at all which is evern better they have nothing to distract them from having fun . Not like young people who spends between forty and fifty hours each week at work . They have much more time to enjoy it . Also , financial wise young people have alot of bills and payments . After school fees , rent and maybe car morgage their is not enough money left to spend for fun or enjoyment . Most of the time elder people dont have these kind of concerns Finaly , the limitations and restrictions forced by the family on their kids donot leave much space for fun . you are not supposed to go their or you are not allowed to be out that late , thats usually what a young member of the family gonna endup getting . Not liek elder ones with total freedom . For all the spare time they have and the avilability of money or abscence of limitaions there is no dought older people enjoy life much more than youn ones do \
(HIN,medium) I agree with this statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because when the people stop at one sucess than how the new invention must be happen or invented in this world , when it happens than the world stops where it is now . In our history it is mentioned we are monkey in the past time now we are working on the laptops and lots of facilities we have because we want to do something new . Successful people have capability to take a risk because when the people is not successful he always fear of getting again the face of unsucess . so this implies that the people who are success always taking a risk rather than only doing what they already did . When it happens than our world is now micro world and now we research for nano , Why we do this ? To take some risk and invent new . to do anything new it take time , it take risk but obviously when you labour hard and do the work you always have some positive result one day . One the enterpreneur stop taking risk while becoming the successful person , thenone he will not be successful because his business become dump because there is no different . always people want to do something different . People need something different , they were getting bore from doing same thing , to do something different they need to take risk . Suitable example for this is Relince company in India . The first enterpreneur of the reliance company is dhirubhai ambani . When he is not risk than he is not on the top most companies . to make himself on the top of the success we always need to take risk . Dhirubhai Ambani starts his business from cloth market now his company starting a real estate business , mobile business and lot of other business allover . this is the great example to satisfy the statement . When the successful dont try to do new things and take a risk they dont go up on the stairs of success they still on the same step and other who eagerly try to do the new things goes up and up on the stairs of success and the person on the same step when sees up he feels he is not on the stair of success he is so much down . So all these examples given above satisfies the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
(SPA,low) I agree with that statment , and in the following lines I will support my idea . When we watch an advertisment about a product , in most of the cases we asume that the product is better than it probably is . In effect , we think that the product has a good cualities because we asume that the producers make a lot of exams to probe his product , but when we buy the product , and we follow the advetisments , we sometimes we can notice that the product has not the sufficient advertisment that it supposed to be . For example , if you buy a pesticide , and in the advertisments say that you can use in home , and you used in the plants of your home , in a few days your plants probably die . The reason of thism is because the advertisments did not tell you that you can not use the pesticide in the plants of your home . As we can see , because the advertisments we assumed that the pesticide was a good product , much better than really is . In conclution , I agree with the statement , because in many times , the the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , and when we used , we noticed that the products are not good .
(CHI,medium) Ok ! Today we talk about be a successful person . Some people think that be a successful person , you need to try new things and take risks . Another group of people think that do the things they already know and try to do it as best as they could . Wow , these two ways are seems that sounds work . What do you think ? Now , I tell you my opinion , I agree that be success is to try new things and take risks . Well , I am not saying that you wo n't be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it as well as you could . Waht i mean is `` improvement is come form trying '' . We need to built up our own success we need to try to take the risks . OK , Let say you in a football team you are the kicker . You work really hard to kick the football everyday and you keep every single step to kick . What you try to do is you never want to make a mistake . You want , once the ball is in front of you , you can kick it in . Ok , finally you are the best kicker . But you forget something . The way you kick everyday is the old way . You did a wonderful job in kicking the football in old way . But there are a 1000 people in the world try to find out another better way to kick the football . So by the time they find that out , you are not the best anymore . No matter being success or be the best , is the same way to do that Keep Improve , Keep Try , Take the Risks and Never Give Up . Success is a compare word . You need someone next to you doing some thing less successful than you , then it will show that you are the one more successful . If you just stand in you own spot never go out to try , one day the people who try will pass you , if you still stay in that spot ten you will makre more people to pass you . So if you you really want to be Successful people , you need to rtry new things and take risks . Otherwise , somebody will pass you one day . ( End )
(FRE,medium) Success does n't happen overnight , it takes lots of work and dedication . I believe that succesful people are risk taker . In this paper I will emphasized my opinion with three points : to be successful , people need to make mistake , to be successful people need to take risk , to be successful you people to explore and try new things . First successful people are not perfect , they learn from their mistake . By making mistake a person depens his experience . The person also open his mind to new ways of doing things . Often when someone makes a mistakes he tries to not replicate the mistake later on . Let 's take as an example Alexander Graham Bell , when he invented the telephone , he made lots of different adjustment some work some did n't . Second , in order to make a mistake a person need to be willing to take risk . If no risks are ever taken there is not mistake that can occur . The same things happen over and over again . The person is in a cycle . Going back to our example , Mr. Bell was deaf , how could he have invented a telephone ? Do n't you need to hear to be able to speak through a telephone ? Mr. Bell took a risk in trying to invent abn object that he , himself , could not use . Third taking risk also means that a person need to expore and try new things . By trying and exploring a person acquire experience and is more able to open his mind to new things . Opening your mind is an important aspect of being succesful because it allows you to see and experience different point of view . Mr. Bell experience clearly show someone who had an open mind and was willing to try and explore new things otherwise he would not have tried to invent a phone but he might have tried to invent something he could have used to communicate as a deaf person . In conclusion , Mr Bell was a successful man because he was willing to make mistake , to take risk and to explore and try new things . Mr Bell did not just sit around and do what he already knew , he went ahead and was successful . So now what are you going to do ? sit around or jump into a successful life ?
(GER,high) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . What will happen with the development of cars ? Will the amount of driving cars in 2030 increase or decrease ? Let 's take a short look on the fast development of cars . They were invented in about the 1920s and became more and more popular for all people all over the world within the last century . Nowadays , it is unbelieveable not to have car or a possibility to lend one , if you need one . People got used to their drivable possibility to get from point A to point B whenever they want to and how often they want to . They do n't depend on any busses , trains or even flights . Even think of the high taxes and fees one has to pay if he uses any public traffics . Beside the fact , a car is one 's chance to get form A to B , a car enables you to feel free and independent . If you want to go on vacation , get your car ready and leave your homecountry . But this , unfortunately , is luxuary , especially in times like this when oil-price is as high as it has never been before . One has to effort his or her car . Having a car , turns out to be a question of money and the possibility to effort it . It 'll be senseless , to spend all your loan on gas , would n't it ? ! Furthermore , the amount of gas that pollutions the air everyday , every minute , exactly every second , is still rising and does n't seem to get less in future . Although there are several techniqual developments and inventions , it 'll be a problem and influences the environment a lot . What will be in about 20 years ? Will people think about this facts and problems and turn into another development of enviromental and social thinking ? Will there be a chance to be fewer cars used than they are today ? In my opinion , I do n't believe in this solution , being fewer cars in 2030 than they are now . People more and more get selfish , always want the best and newest version of an invention ( car ) and they probably will change a certain way of group , social and enviromental thinking but they wo n't change their behavior towards car-using . In my opinion , there are only two things that will lead a change in the amount of cars used . First the changing of laws by the government enforcing people to fullfill certain policies in car using ( such as car sharing , car-free days , etc . ) and second if the oil price is still increasing !
(JPN,medium) Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are today , but it is a part of product and bisiness . they have to suvive in business world to conpet with other company . Therefore , there are some great effect to reach their goles what company make a good profits . First , the advatisement should attract coustemers attention becosue companise have to sell the product to manege their company . Most contents of same conseption product are really simmiler with others , so their advertisments are key to reach thier gole or not . They have more chance to be buy customer becosue attracting ad is showed great products . Therefore , the ad is part of product and it also make a big advantage to sell . Second , the ad does n't tell teh doute becouse canpany has duty to show the content in back side of pacage . Sometime , costomer said the ad made them canfuse to chose the product . However , they can check real procuct content on the pacage . Therefore , making great ad is legal and I think campany have to forcus on that too same as product . Third , great ad show the trend in the period and also it dicreas fee of other advertisemant because it get many coustomer and those coustomer have them . It is one of the big a
(TUR,medium) there are a lot of responsibilities on the young peoples shoulders . they are trying to discover themselves , discover their abilities , their place in the communuty eventually draw their own path . I believe eventhough i spend most of my time for studying , i give time to helping my community . is it enough ? I think this statement is both true and not true for different reasons . it is true in a way that we do n't do our best . we can spend a lot more time to make our city a better place . we can take part actively in regualtions . also we can spend more time with the elderly . we can do this by carefully planiong our spare times . but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends whan we have time . one of the reasons for tghis is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before . almost everything in out lives can be done with professionals . because of this people less intefere to eachpothers lifes . on the other hand its true that we are doing what ever we can . even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the communuty . I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need something . I am living in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters . I ask to them if they need anything when I am going to the market or example . If something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes , i interfere and help . If I am not aware what can i do about it ? I think this sentence is both tur and not true from different views . It is true that young people might be little bit isolated from community and because of this they are nto helping much . but youngs , especially students are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be balmed for not giving enough time . it is communuties responsiblity to create the occasions for sharing and helping .
(ITA,high) My personal experience leads me to state that knowing the facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts , mainly because I think one should try to be as indepenent as possible in life , this including the way one 's own ideas are formed after being explained from a third party in order to be understood . I think what I am looking for is probably an impossible concept : objective information , or any facts one would like to make research on that are not pre-processed or in any way filtered . Facts , although affacted by who they are represented and reported by , are far more objective than ideas and concepts that may be communicated by other people , simply because if one is given the idea or concept already , he or she will not be given the right to a more personal judgment . I think this topic particularly affects me , since I have progressively become aware of how much more knowledge of facts I need in order to understand the present matters of the society I live in . This includes the understanding of politics in my country in the first place and internationally in the second place , obviously followed by History . Recently I finally manged to find some time out of my schedule for reading more about the histoy of the last century in Italy , while the next step will be the People 's History , a book on the American History , probably followed by some reasearch on another main topic of our recent times : wars on terror and their political as well as historical backgrounds . I am convinced that only facts can make me have the whole picture and that only a vast eagle view on them , as a multiple-sourced investigation can offer , will eventually lead closer to a better , more solid objective idea , concept or belief to stick with when choosing in life .
(ITA,medium) First of all i do not agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy their life more than older peolple . I think that the way to enjoy life is different but this not imply what the statement says . Today young people can enjoy in several ways , respect one or two generations ago because is permited almost everything : for example have the car very early , to go out every weekend and spend a lot of money to take drinks and to go to the disco with some friends . They can also enjoy themself organizing some party between compains of school or university . A friend of mine told me that he went to Danmark as erasmus student and he descibed me that experience as a beautiful thing . Every day he enjoyed his life going to erasmus party that took place almost every evening in the university place . He told me also that the mainly enjoy it was the beer and the disco . In stead , the fact that the older persons do not do the same things it does not mean that they enjoy less : they have only other interestes . The major part of older persons are married and for this reason the prefer enjoy their free time going , for example , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaurant for a romantic dinner . Of course many older people could have son or daughter and this imply that they do not have the same time respect the young people , to spend for enjoy themself . The have to do a lot of thing into house and at the work .
(JPN,low) It is a difficult question , but for me , the choice is clear . I disagree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are two reasons ; the prevention of the reallity and the conclution of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers . The first reason is the prevention of the reallity . It is based on the situation that customers ordinally make a judge from the advertisement whether they buy it or not . I think advertisements should be besed on the products . The role of the advertisements is telling customer what the products rally are and what points are distinguish on other products . The advertisements should be neesded the reallity of the products . The second reason is the construction of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers . The advertisement explains about the product , so the custmer can buy it without anxious . Those are my opinions . Thus , I disagree the following statement .
(ITA,high) I believe that facts can be learned in many different ways and that school has a different object than teaching students facts . A school 's duty is to both prepare the student for his entrance in real life , and to open a student 's mind through the constant teaching of concepts and ideas everytime more difficult . Facts must be examined and fully explored in order to understand what lies beneath them . Facts are nothing more then the final chapter of many causes put together . Why birds migrate every year , why people cry when they are sad or why the sky is clear or cloudy ? All of these questions could not be answered only by observation . The laws of cause and effect studied during the past centuries explain us the importance to know the basic concepts that rule the world . Every phenomenon , every situation or consequence come from a precise cause . If we can know that cause then we are able to control the consequence , weather we want to repete it or avoid it . I believe that the primary objective of universities , or schools in general , is to give to their scholars as many informations as possible . Then , it will be the studient who will decide how to use these informations . Facts can teach you many things , they can show you all the possibile outcomes for every event , and they can help you to predict the future based on previous episodes . But facts alone , I believe , can not be consider enough for somebody 's growth .
(ARA,medium) Usually , people are familliare with what they used to do . Some people fears from new things because they are not sure about it , or because they cannot take risk even if this action could open a new doors for them toward good future . I believe that a person should take this risk sometimes and trying new things in his or her life because I think that the ability of the our minds in unlimited . Therfore , I completely agree with the opinion that says people who try new things are able to be more successful . In our life , getting risk is fundemental part of our world . No one can expect what could happen to him or her . So , I think it is worth it to try new things , use new methood , or meet new people . Many successful people built their successful on a moment that they were breaf . For example , the famos actor `` Arnold '' , he can be just like any other actores , but he decide to engage in the political world and now , he is the governor of California Sate . I consider his decision as breaf and smart decision because after few years he would loos his ability to be good and attractive actore because of his age . Many people cannot go out of the `` box '' that they found themselves in . I agree with some peole who believ that every person should be specilized in his or her major . I do not suggest that a teacher can be a doctor , but I believe that this teacer could be a great buisenessman for example . Therefore , getting riske could be making g
(TEL,medium) Technology is going on increasing day-by-day and many of the people are not getting stick to one thing . They are planning to get in touch with atleast something about the other subjects and gain some knowledge about that . I partially agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' because getting specialized in one area may be useful but the person must have atleast some idea about the others also . For example , B.Tech offers number of courses like Computers , Electrical , Mechanical , Communications etc .. Any student who joins in any of these courses come across some subjects related to these courses i.e. I 'm a Computer Science student and I 'll come across many subjects in my curriculum which include some Electrical and Communications subjects also . Along with these I 'll come across specialized subjects in Computers after two years . Specialized subjects give me the knowledge how to design , analyze , code and test our projects that are going to be done in future . And if I would like to choose any of the field after my B.Tech I must have atleast some idea about the other subjects . If I would like to learn mobile repairing after my graduation I must have some idea about Cellular and Mobile Communications which I have already gone through in my curriculum . It make my work easy in mobile repairing , by having some idea about the subject in advance . By summarizing the above points there is a need to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects and specialization in one specific subject because , if a person is interested in his own field he may go that side and others can get some benefit by having atleast some knowledge about other subjects .
(CHI,medium) Advertisements were one of the most powerful commercial ways to stimulate customer to pay for the product . I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The purpose of an advertisements is to attract your notion and inspire you to have a try with the product . There are different kinds of advertisements , such as posters , commercial on TV , and advertisements on the Internet . No matter wich of them , photos of the products was the most important and necessary materials to creat an advertisements . The more attractive the photo looks loke , te more possibility the customers will buy it . Bsed on this idea , businessmen will try their best to have the product photo reaches the perfect condition . For instance , in food advertisement , the photo of food always seems shining and delicious , and there will also be some decoration by the dishes . But in the actual situation , the quality of the food in restaurant might change , or even get worse . For another example , in cloth advertisement , the company will find beautiful models to wear the new dresses , thus , dresses will seem more fitful and wonderful on model . By seeing those product on such a perfect condition , many people will be stimulated to take a look or have a try on the new products . Sometimes , the businessmen will not expect you to buy it , but as long as you saw the advertisement once , you will have a image in your brain . Then , you may one day try it , or tell the information to your friends . As more experiences in your life , you will recognize what kind of advertisements are far decorated from the true product and what are similar with the real product . For the most famous brand , their advertisements are really close the the real product . Sometimes , just think as you are a businessman , you will realize why the advertisements will always seem better !
(SPA,medium) Nowadays lots of people look for success but they do not take risks to achive it . From my point of view , success is something that you have to look for and to work for but it is not something that comes to you without effort . Thus , you have to take risks rather than keep your whole life only doing what you know as it decreases the possibilities to be succesful . On the one hand , some people decide to dedicate their entire life to do what they already know how to do well but who knows if there is something that you could do better but you are not aware about it ? For instance , if you are a very good dentist but you have always been working for someone else you will never know if your own bussiness would be more succesful than the one of the person whom you are working for . On the one hand , you could be working your whole life for someone else and doing what you know how to do , dentistry in this case . On the other hand , you could take the risk to open your own bussiness and even to create your own franchise . Nevertheless , taking risks does not mean success because your bussiness can fail and you can loose money as well . For example , if you decide to open your own practice you can find that you have not patients and of course , that you have no money . But , you can realize that with the time your number of patients increases as well as your money and that your practice is being successful . However , you can never know if a project is going to be succeed if you do not risk and try it . Therefore , people can work in what they know how to do well and become succesful after have risked something , in this case money to invest . Whereas , peolple that is working in what they know how to do but they do not take risk are less likely to succeed . So , we should take risks in order to succeed and also to learn what we did wrong if we have been unsuccessful .
(ITA,medium) I think that economical growth is strictly connected to improvements in people 's creativity , that lead to new innovative solutions . I think that experiments can turn a man into a successful person . For example , when I arrived in my current newsroom as law reporter , the rivalry with my collegues spurred me to find new solution in order to reach better results . I suddenly noticed that my older coworker were too attached to obsolete idea and were not really interested in radical improvement , but I went forward with my ideas . I tried new types of telecommuting , from internet to laptop to digital photo camera in order to provide my articles in real time . The outcome was amazing : the productivity increase of 60 % and we were able to print more pages with better articles , thanks to the new speed of working . One time I had to take high risks that , fortunately , turns out in amazing results . I used undercover brand new tecniques , unknown in the history of the journalism in Asti , my hometown , and I could unveil the biggest political scandal ever occured there . Ten actors were provided with bugs and I eavesdropped drug bargains between a well-known mobster and a group of corrupted politicians . A prosecutor , on the base of the evidences collected by me and my assistants , took a successful judiciary action against these criminals . However , sometimes an experiment of new things can turn into a failure . Before Wright 's Brothers , a lot of scientists tried to built a plane but they died during the tryout of the devices . And some inventors , like Antonio Meucci , did n't reach success . Infact , he actually invented the telephone but the merit was taken but another person , Graham Bell . In conclusion , I keep to strongly believe that being open-minded is always a success , even if it does n't make you richer or
(TEL,medium) I agree with the statement that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts . Understanding ideas and concepts is important for students to acquire knowledge . Once if the Student gets idea of the concept he can easily understand the fact . Let us take an example regaring this statement . suppose if a student has a brief idea of politics then he can understand what is going on in the present world and presenrt country . He can even describe how is it going on and what is wrong and right . I state that understanding concept is the main criteria of the subject or lecture . If a student understands a concept throughly he can score good marks and he never forgets that concept and ideas in his life time . This is the way of student to develop in his thinking and he can easily grasp the facts going around . Ideas and concepts plays an important role in the present education system and present world . Suppose if a person is having nill knowledge about politics it is difficult for him to understand the facts going around . If he dont know what is the concept of work and energy he cant understand the common day to day activities . Let us take english if a student dont know the language and alphabets of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spellings . If a person has nill knowledge about a topic he cant write an essay . Concepts and facts are very important in all acepts . If he just learn facts he gets half knowlege of the concept . He can understand only a part of the theory not totally and completely . So i conclude that ideas and concepts play important role in understanding facts . '' As great philospher said that half knowledge is always dangerous '' .
(KOR,medium) Cars destroy environment . So there are many peoples that dont't like cars . And there are many other way to moving . Some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . But I disagree with this idea . I have three reasons for cars in use will increase . Firse is by calculating , Second is by scientists . Third is by people mind . There are first reason . After cars made , cars in use was increased without exapt . And many people who do n't have a car wants buy a car . In simple calculate , we can imagine that the number of cars will increase . Second reason is here . We can solve cars-environment problem . There are many scientist that study about cars-environment problems . And they reported the way for solve car-environment problems . And nowdays , there are electric-car and hybernation-car . Third , people wants move fast . And moving by Car is easy and economy way for move to near place . For example , when you want to go to friend 's party , and the friend 's house is 1 Km from your house . What way is easy and economy way ? You can not use plane for 1Km . And Ther are no terminal between your house and your friend 's house . We discussed about future of cars in use . There are three reasons for cars in use will increase . first , in past , cars in use was increased . Second , we are solving cars-environment problems . Third , people want move fast . So we can think easily that cars in use will be more .
(CHI,medium) Some people may believe that there will be more car in use in futhre , but I disagree . I ca n't imagine that there have enough space and streets can be used for more cars . First because the traffic jam are more and more common in nowadays . So many cars in our country can not be used efficently because there are lots of traffic jams in every street at early moning 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 . In work hours , I only need to spent 20 minutes to get school from my appartment , but it 's taken nearly 90minutes in rush hours . It 's a waste of time . A lot of friends of mine told me that , they would not going to buy any car because ther is n't enough roads can be use for solve the traffic problem . Second , there are more and more pollutions made by cars . When I was 6 , I could always see lots of stars in every evening sky . But I can not see them recently , becanse the pollutions are to heavy to cover the sky . The smokes that seeked by the cars are making a lot of pullutions in the air . And it 's seemed so harmful to our heathy . Third , the price of the oil incressed a lot , that made many people did n't want to buy a car . I alwanys saw so many cars only parked in the parking space that are did n't drive in . And when I asked a owner why he did n't drive his car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive his car for 2 years can buy another car . That seems like we must spend as much or more mony we buy the car to buy the oil . Taken the above reasons into account , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today . Not only more cars mean more spaces will be taken , also means few pollutions and lots bebefits for our heathy .
(SPA,medium) I do agree with the fact that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to understand facts . I base this agreement basically in personal experience , but also because it has been proved that it 's the best way of learning things . That does n't mean that we have to avoid facts and leave them to concrete moments , sometimes facts are useful in a special ocassion , but it 's common that facts are forgetful than general concepts . It 's like building a house . It 's important to have a toilet in the house , or a bed . But if the house has n't got a solid structure , the bed or the toilet do n't mean anything , because they 're going to be destroyed one way or another . But if the structure is solid , the house will remain in its place and the toilet will be able to be in the place a toilet has to be . Sometimes , it 's going to have problems , like everything and everyone , but it 's going to be there . When a person is learning a new thing , whether if it 's a new concept or a whole new subjetc , it 's necessary for that person to have some clear ideas before introducing any more information in his head . The person needs a map of the new thing in his brain . The risk will be that if those general ideas are not clear , the ones that are going to come after are going to be forgotten , because the person does n't know where to situate them . If the ideas are clear , the person is going to asimilate the facts easier and it 's going to be harder for him to forget them . For example , about some months ago I had to learn how to use an editing program called Avid . The fist lessons that I took were a chaos , nobody undestood how that program worked out , and when the teacher showed us special features inside it , we ended the lessons worst than before , because we were able to see a whole mess of a program with no order inside it . In the moment we learned how to use the program , how the different formats worked , we were able to use all its special features . And not only that but now we 're learning another postproduction program , and what took us about two months to learn with the Avid , tooked us three lessons with the new one , just because we had in our mind the general idea of how postproductions programs work .
(KOR,high) I strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of two reasons . First , older people had already enjoyed their lives when they were young . Second , older people can still enjoy their lives . Before my grandfather died , couples of years ago . He used to tell me about his life when he was young . He used to tell me all his stories about ; his girlfriends , his adventures and his passion . But , he cleared me something , he told me that he still enjoyed his life . This is a clear example of how much older people enjoyed their lives and they are still enjoying it . The time of enjoyment is like two or three times longer than what we , young people , have enjoyed . Therefore , it all sumarizes that older people enjoy life more that young people do . As mentioned before , older people are still enjoying their lives , some young people would say that , older people can not use the Internet or go to an amusement parks like them . But , that is completely wrong . I have a friend , whose grandmother plays computer games with him . I could not believe it until I saw her playing with us . My friends grandmother likes going to amusement parks too . Last summer , we went to Wonderland together , it was simply amazing ! Here , we can see another example of older people enjoying their lives . In my opinion , if older people are healthy enough and strong enough , they can do whatever they would like to do . To sumarize everything up , I disagree with the statement and I think older people enjoy life more than younger people because older people already enjoyed their lives before and they keep on enjoying it .
(KOR,low) I agree with this opinion . when i was traveled thiland by myself . there was too many problems happend . as im a girl . i was threatend my securities . it was really stressful . and i ca n't conversation with thai peoples . i did n't know how to deal with many problems like housings , eatings .. so travel in a group led by a tour guide has many beneficial . First of all , you will protect from a guide and group . security is very important when you are traveling new places . Secon reason is that tour guide knows well about travel and which place is recomendable . so you do n't need to spend your time for considering about which place is more good to travel . Third reason is that you do n't need to worry about housing and eatings . generally a tour guide is speak a very good local language and a tour guide leds group of a people . so fee for room is more cheap . and most tour companies related to bunch of hotel changes . if you travel as a group member you do n't need to worry about food. a tour guide helps you what you eat on the travel . all you need to do is just enjoy your vacation
(TEL,medium) I will disagree that there will be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years . I can give the following reasons for my opinion . Firstly , the population of the world is increasing exponentially . This will increse the the need of transport . When viewed in detail about majority of the countries , the chief means of transport is car . As per to satisfy the needs of growing population the usage cars will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statement The second reason is the declination in cost of car . When studied about the statatics from the time of invention of car . The cost of cars is declined to a larger extent . This made cars available to the large middle class societies in the world . Since the economic and financial status of the people are incresing the middle class societies also incresing . This mens the need of car is also incresing . This combines the declining prices of car and the usage of car will be incresed . This means that in the near future the usage of car will be further incresed . Nowadays cars are manufactured which runs on battery . So , eventhough shortage of the petroleum resources will never reduce the usage of the cars . Car has become the comfortable transport .. The comfortability will increase with the advancements in the technology furthermore , which makes people to use cars as their chief means of transport . Also cars are safier to travel when compared to bikes and cycles . In view of the above reasons I believe that the usage of car will never decrease in the next twenty years .
(FRE,medium) Nowadays , we can see that there is a lack of consideration of the communitie by the young people , there is not engough help received from the youth and the question that sould be asked is why ? we can see that the youth is more focused in things like music , fun , drug abuse , pornography , or other things that do not contibute in the developpemt of the society . there is a lack of interest in communitary work , and the fact that with the evolution of techonolgy , people are now stuck in they working place make it harder for the youth , thre is the new kind of industry of games , gameboy , playstation ... keeping the youth on the inside of the house rather than giving them the opportunity of working for exemple with elders , or playing more outside We think that if the working time were less compulsive give the chance to famillies to have quality time , things will change . people will have the opporutnity to participate more the fact is that young people needs to be made interrested on the kind of services that they could provide to the community , in order to increase their living and other . following what was said ti this essay we can agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
(ARA,medium) I think that will depend mainly on the stage of the students . For primary school students , I think it is much better for them to learn facts simply because students at this stage will not be able to understand ideas or concepts . Secondary school students are able to understand ideas and concepts simply because they have already background about facts from the primary school . The situation for the students in the college stage is different as well . I think it is much better for undergraduate students to learn facts by taking many courses of different subject areas . That will give them the opportunity to broad their knowledge about various topics . So after graduation , during their graduate studies , they may take courses in only their subject area . By this way , they will able to work in detail on their major area of study and of course learn ideas and concepts in depth . This definitely what is happening in the US Universities and faculties where students in the undergraduate stage are offered to take some required courses and many elective courses . So during their graduate studies , they may take many courses thats related to their major for one year or so . Unfortunately , in my Country we only learning facts all the time . I think thats the main cause of jobless in my country . I hope one day , I can change the way of learning in my country . As a conclusion , both policy of learning are required depending on the stage of the students .
(ITA,high) Have you never observed general behaviour of a group of people , let us say a school class ? If you have , you probably distinguished some particularly shy students , some other more quiet or polite . Among these behaviours , you surely have been able to notest the most brave one , the one who did something that nodoby else did . This is the leader . The leader is , for instance , the student who have the courage to tell the professor about something inconvinient . If we bring this situation out of the school , we can say that the leader , the successful person , is the brave one . Thi means that those persons who have never the courage to try something hard , different and new , have few possibilities to succeed . One reason for wich I believe that brave people are likely to be successful is that they normally love challenges , and challenges are opportunities to learn . A genuine curiosity also characterizes brave people often . Curiosity means aquiring a wide knowledge , which a good starting point of a successful life . On the other hand , those who never pluck up the courage to measure themselves against challenging situations have few possibilities to enlarge their skills . Moreover , such a behaviour reveals scarce curiosity and features people who are not willing to learn and improve themselves . The second reason is that successful people definitely need to be self confident , and brave people necessarly are . In fact , a successful life is often the result of many successful battles . In order to win all these , people must be confident in their abilities . I consider brave people to have this approach when they chase new challenges . In conlcusion , I definitely believe that a brave approach to challenges is required from those who want to be successful in their lives . Brave people are not frighten of the events that may occur , and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situations .
(HIN,high) I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities . To be more clear , by young people i would mean people in the age group of 20-35 yrs . As times are changing , people are getting more and more involved with themselves , and the materialistic pleasures of life . This is especially true of the young generation , who value money more than anything . As a result , most of the attention of our youth is on earning money , and hence they are busy fulfilling their aim . Today 's world is very competitive and in this struggle , young people often do not find the time to contribute to their community . Another reason for such a thing , is that communities are no longer close knit as they used to be . There is a lesser feeling of belonging to some particular community , and there is the emergence of a global community . More and more people travel to various places , and hence it is difficult for them to associate with a particular community . Reasons apart lets state some examples from our experiences . One such example is the lack of participation of youth in voluntary organisations , such as those for educating the poor people . It might be true that young people contribute money in such schemes , but we dont see too many young people , actually going out there and teaching . Another example is the absence of young leaders in our government . Young people do not find such a career very financially rewarding and hence abstain from actively participating in the functioning of a government . So as time is progressing , young people are getting motivated to work more for themselves , than for their communities . I would not say that this is true for all young people , but it would hold true in most cases . Such a drift away from community responsibility is primarily motivated by the current lifestyle of the younger generation .
(ITA,high) In today 's world the younger generation is seen as careless and and lazy . Often we hear parents talking about how they do n't understand the life their children live and how they do not have any ideology they strongly believe in , like the one they had in the sixties wich were all about respect and help . As a young person I believe that I have some prospective on the situation nowadays . It is true that in the past years young people were more interested in music and their friends , especially in the ninetees where music became more angry with groups like nirvana and metallica that had very negative images to show their audiences . This violent reaction was in part due to the fact that the image they had of past generations was not great . For example the hippie period in wich most of their parents lived in was long gone and all their ideals had been abandonned , therefore `` peace and love '' was n't a reference any more because it had been a failure , so they had to find a new way of expressing themselves and tried the complete opposite . However today more and more teenagers are feeling responsible for the world they live in . They are now aware that they have a responsability towards the future and take more time to consider the possibilities offered to them . Of course some are still unconsiderate and uninterested but others are making changes . We see a lot more humanitarian organisation runned by young adults , for example in my school there are three projects that involve fundraising and the education of others on the issues of the world like poverty and global environment and all of them were founded and are runned by students . this shows teenagers help improve their surroundings and community because they become more respectful and involved . It is therefore a mistaken idea to think that the younger generation is becoming worse every day . It has over the years experienced different ways to portray itself and these changements have been essential for the future generations because it will give them an idea about the risks of going to the extremes and resulting from that will be a more balanced and helpful group of young people .
(GER,high) In my opinion there 's something true in this statement but it 's not quite accurate . Succesful people are regared to be very rich , famous and wealthy . So if an famous actor decided to take the risk of quitting the movie buisness and to start a whole new career ( for example as professional football player ) he would n't be taking any risk at all . If he failed he would have enough money to survive this episode of `` new life finding '' and the whole world would report about his attempt to change his job . So everybody would know about his `` risky '' plan which is n't risky at all in fact because he 's got nothing to lose . Inspite of this unsuccessful people would have huge problems if they tried to change their job because they would n't have any savings to life from if they did n't succeed . Furthermore nobody would know about this risky attempt because no newspaper or TV station would be interested in this particular change . I think the media gives us the impression that successful people are trying new things more often than the common people because we are directly confronted with their new ideas . Let 's give an example : David Beckham ( a famous soccer player from Great Britain ) changed his haircut every few months and the whole world was impressed by his new style and courage to do so . At the same time I dyed my hairy every week to another beautiful color but nobody execept my worried mum was interested in this . Fame and success make it possible to inform ( even without the intention to do so ) the huge mass about the new things certain people are trying . Another exemple : When Arnold Schwarzenegger decieded to start a political career every newspaper reported about this sensational event but when I won the election to the new head of the sports club not even the local newspaper was interested in this . To summarize : Successful people are n't taking more risks or trying new things than the normal human being is , the only difference is that the media reports about them .
(SPA,high) Supposedly , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . The truth is that both having a broad knowledge about a cornocopia of subjects and specializing in one subject are very important factors to being successful in whatever a person does in his life . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you along in the future . It will help to develop yourself as a person like it will also create many interesting conversations in life . For example , if a student is spacializing in art when he is asked a question about modern tecniques , it will be important for that student to know about historical events , not only in the art world but also what was going on in the country he or she is speaking of . It will be vital for that student to understand the politics of that time , the hardships of the people , and many other contributing factors that are involved in the development of the tecnique in question . Another example to why knowing about different subjects is important is to make yourself more educated and impress people when you speak because they get an image of you as a person that is not ignorant . Specializing in one subject is also a vital factor in life because it is easyer to find a job when one has speciallized in one subject . People still need specialists to work on their equipment and to run their companies . For example , if your computer breaks down you will not ask someone who knows about computers but doesnt know how to fix it to reppair it for you , you will ask a specialist , someone that knows alot about computers because that is his strong point and he can fix it for you . But nothing sais that you cant be a specialist and have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects . In conclusion , both factors ( having a broad knowledge about many subjects or specializing in one subject ) are vital to having success in life . Both will help you mature and decrease your ignorance level and both will increase your wisdom and your educational level .
(CHI,medium) There is a recently discussion about if young people enjoy life more than old people do or not . As far as I am concerned , I think the young people can enjoy life more because of the characteristices of young people that is internatonl , mobilization and the ablity to communication . To begin with , with the advent of Internet , the world we living in is becoming more smaller than before . today 's young people can easily get in touch with the most popular cultures in the world . they are more international than their parents hence they can enjoy the movies in Holywood from America , the most fashion clothes from Paris and the most exciting football plays from the Endland . because of this , they enjoy the life more . Furthermore , today ; s young people is mobilization . By car , train and air , they can travell to where they want to go . Just contradicting the low quality of transporation their parents having in the past time , we can responbsible to say that the young enjoy life more . The young people can go sight-seeing and enjoy the magnificant cultures all over the world . In addition , for the various ways that people can make a communication , the young peole gain more stronger ability to communicate with others and it makse them more friends . During their study time they can meet lots of people who may be come from different places even countries . those people all may help the young people or provide them many opportunities when they begin to work . so the young people can enjoy life more . but the old people may not enjoy so much friendship because of the limitation of ways of communication . From what has been discussed aboved , we can safety draw a conclusion that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
(ARA,medium) I agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide . Last summer i went to Itlay with a group and a tour guide , I liked my trip becuse I meet new people form diffrent places and shier same informations . If I did not with the guide I would miss many places in Italy . In the same time , I did not konw the history for the places i had visit . Two years ago , I went to Japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost because , we did not speake thier language and did not know thier transportion system . Travel with the group and the tour guide is cheper than trave alone and you cane see more places in limited time . In addation , some trave agents have many tours so , you can select what you like . However , they have programs during the trip to make the travels enjoy they trip . There is bad thing when travel with group , some pepol do not respect the others and make the travelers do not like the trip . But in genral I prefe travel with group and a tour guide .
(JPN,medium) I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today due to the following reasons . Firstly , I believe that in the future , people will travel not only to the regions in the neibourhood but also for the far remoted areas , which include foreign countries . It will bcome possible in line with establishment of highways , constructing the huge bridges between countries and convenient carry system such as huge ferries to transport such car In passage of time , more and more people need to move by themselves for their own purpose because business will be expanded to the wordwide and it is essential to keep mobility for individuals . Car could be desired and obtained per person like as is the case for mobile phone . Therefore , the situation could be happen that each individual will have own car per person . Secondly , I belive that there should be some technical enhancement to the cars and the subsistue energy of petro oils will be invented and introduced to the cars by the engineering and research of automobile companies . The examples of such fuels are electroricity , energy created by nature such as sun or oxigion and so on and it is also good for the environment . Such introdution of new energy will decrease the cost to maintain the cars than today and I presume that more and more people can have an access to cars with smaller initial investment . I am insisting the above oponion on the assumption that the form of the car could be changed and transformed like the one now develpoed by some of Japanese companies and current concept of car would change . The car could become much smaller one which allows only one person to ride and safety is assured in order that people could move place to place by such own veihcle . With the above three reasons , I personally belive that more cars can be introduced than today in the future .
(FRE,high) The world is already aware of the harm that the industrial revolution has made to the atmosphere . Since it is an issue of worldwide importance restriction policies are implemented in the most developed countries . Until new technologies will be discovered , unfortunately thos restriction policies will not work . There are few reasons for this . First it is evident that with the growth of the quality of human health , people will live longer and so the number of human beings on earth will considerably increase . Thus the number of potential car drivers will increase allso . Even though countries will try to limit car use and develope public transportation the development of human socities combined with the globalization will creat a bigger need for cars all over the world . The developing or underdeveloped countries will need cars and all the new possibillities provided by cars in order to develop their economies . Almost all the African continent will need motorized vehiculs in order to create a strong economy and ways to trade with their neighbours . Moreover if we look at the recent boom in the Indian and Chinese economy we may suggestt that in twenty years those two great countries will also be the first car importers as their populations are the greatest compared to the ones of any other country in the world . As the average conditions of living of the populations around the world are slowly and enequally increasing there are still some countries that did not undergo the industrial revolution . I t seems quite obvious then that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years . There may be fewer cars in the occidental countries as Europe or the United States or at least they will be less polluting . As a conclusion I would say thay even with the best will of the politics thr car is still a product that is not only usefull but also beautifull for some people . It can be used for a lot of different purpouses and as a lot of people like to show off and live in great luxury , the car will not disapear in the next twenty years .
(ARA,medium) traveling is the best thing we can do it when we have free time or a vacation . Traveling has a lot of benefits . traveling is the best way to learn another cultures and another languages . When you have any problem with your life , wife and even your boss , you should take a rest and travel to another country or city . Howeve , some people prefer to travel in a group but others totally disagree with this idea . I agree with traveling in a group led by guide is the best way . Also , it has many benefits When you travel to any country , you want to visit the most famous and important places in that country . Also , you do not want to waste time to find that places . That is why i prefer to have a traveling guide . For example , last year i went to Eygpt . It was a nive vacation , but i could not find what i want quickly . everyday I asked more than guy about how can i find that hotel or famous places in Eygpt . Inn adition , guides make your tour very interesting . On the other hand , guides help you to choose good hotel and the best company for renting cars and tell you where is the best restaurants . Traveling in a group is so safety , for example , my friend went to an arabic country when he got there , some men hit him and stole his money . Finally . I really interesting in traveling . Every year i go to a different country . It is very good to upfresh me . It is a good idea to forget problems in our life . i advise everyone to travel in a group because it has many benefits and it is safety . I really like to visit famous places .
(ITA,medium) The most important thing to remeber is the meaning of the word advertising . Advertising means to communicate to a specific target the best carachteristics of the product or of the service for that focus target . The advertisements have to follow a basic rule : sell out as much as possible . If a man asks to a nice woman go out for dinner , what do you think he will show of himself to her ? It 's a very easy question , everybody knows . He will be elegant , nice and kind . He will pay the dinner also for the girl and he will drop up her to her house . What about if we go to an interview for a very important job ? we will show our best . The boss will know that nobody can be perfect but If we will not show our best in such a important interview we are not so clever . It 's up to us : we have to sell yourself ! I think is the same think with the advertisement . They show us the best but we know that something ca n't be as good as showing there . The big companies spend a huge quantity of money to do advertising and they must have a feedback after . Ovviously they try to show you the best things in their products or in their services because they want that the custumer buy them . But we also must remember that now the law is very strickt about the false advertisement . The companies have to follow the rules and ca n't tell to the target something untrue . In every situation we try to show our best and they try to do the same with the products or the services . It 's their job . It 's important to not be superficial in every aspects in our life : from the advertisements to the people we could meet . Remember to be focus in what we really need . There is a child story with a little girl with a red dress . Everyone knows this story and every story has a moral : they want to teach us to do n't believe in everything . So let 's try to remeber the little girl and her adventure !
(JPN,medium) I disagree with the statement showing `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . For example , why do all of us deeply study about history ? This is because the knowledge of facts which happened in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the future . There is a famous Japanese sentence shown as `` Open your future by learning from the past '' . This exactly explains why it is important to learn facts . Furthermore , I think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past . For instance , the idea to launch the United Union , involving all nations in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflicts by preventing war , was created after the big event , the 2nd World War . After learning that this kind of war means nothing to whole of the world and all of the population , the genius leaders had reached to this idea . Therefore , I think that it is also very important for students to learn facts as much as understanding ideas and concepts .
(SPA,high) When it comes to car use , the tendency seems to be upward sloping and that is why I believe that twenty years from now , there will be more cars than there are today ; but I believe that cars wont be the same as they are today . Within the past fifty years , the number of cars has grown drastically worldwide . If we take a look back in time we can easily realize that during the 1950's families were accostumed to having one car if any per household , while today , on the other hand , most families tend to own two cars . This growth pattern could have been caused by changes that have taken place in society such as the incorporation of more women to the labor force , but the truth is that today we have more cars than we used to . Therefore , it seems reasonable to expect a continuous increase in the number of automoviles within the next twenty years . It is true that car use keeps incrementing , but it is also true that now people are more concious of the environmental problems than they were before , and that is why reforms are being put in place in order to reduce car use . Such reforms include high parking rates and taxes on big automoviles , such as jeeps . While these reforms seem harsh , the number of cars has not been decreased substancially and that is why I believe that the tendency will continue to be upward sloping . On the other hand , while I believe that automoviles will keep increasing , their manufacture will have to be more environmentally concious and that is why cars will not be the same as they are today . A possible change which seems to work is the use of hydroelectric engines ( engines which are electrically powered ) . These vehicules utilize water tanks in order to generate motion . Another posibility is incorporating sun pannels in cars , just like the ones which are now used in homes in order to obtain energy from the sun 's rays . Both these technologies , are less pollutant than the technology implemented in regular cars and that is why it seems reasonable that new cars will implement one of these two . In conclusion , I believe that the number of cars will continue to grow during the next twenty years , but I also understand that the situation is unsustainable as it is today and that is why car technology will have to change drastically in order to protect our planet from pollution ; therefore , cars will have to change .
(ITA,low) I agree with those who believe that more advertisements make products seem much better than they realy are for tha following reasons : the costomers are more sensible for the external aspect of the products , if the advertisement exalts some particular the product become more interesting and a funny music or presentation may involve the costomer to buy . If the advertisement uses an inteligent presentation the costomers hase more interest for it . For example if I product a cake for children and I show attractive ad funny characters with my product in their hands ad I give some gifts with this , my cake will be selled a lot . Otherwise , If I do n't make some expedient my product appears not good . Second , using tips like show how better a soap clean your flood but using another soap or a lot of whashes . Finaly , if the costomer see a funny music , presentation o situation , he remembers the products better and if he find it in a supermarket with anoter tipe of same product , he chose the first .
(CHI,medium) Different people have different answers to this statement . It depends on the person 's personality , perferences and characters . Those people who have more working experiences will think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I hold this view point too . First of all , companies hair many movie stars , famous singers , as well as those politicans to sing high praise for the products . Consumers will think the products will as good as those stars , because they wo n't hire those unfimilar people to the mass . But actually , will those products ' quality is as good as those stars ? I think most of the time the answer is no . We should judge the products quality by experient or by our experience . Second , most advertisements use a lot of fancy method to attract consumers . They use television , radio , magazines , newspapers and internet to attract them . These kind of mass media can give the reader more colorful and lively demonstrations . It exceed the original products and give the consumer the fake idea . Third , most advertisments express their ideas with too much good words . We all have the experience that we were introduced a kind of products by the advertisments that their products is the best in all of the same products , their products can be uses more than 100 years , the car they sold is the cheapest . But what is the truth , maybe it is a very bad product .
(KOR,medium) It may be true that everyone wants to be successful . But to become succeed is not easy . If we refer to some people who have succeed in their life , we can find that what they did in order to succeed is not as same and simple as normal people do . It is common that people who were successful have a common trait . That is , they tried new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and I agree to this . We can find the evidence of the statement as we read the articles of the lives of famous people such as Thomas Edison who was a genious in invention . Also , there is a rule in the business that successful business people try new things and take risks . I remember readinig an article about the life of Thomas Edison when I was young . While reading it , I did n't understand why Thomas Edison tried to hatch an egg by himself , do experiments in the train , and other `` unpredictable '' things he did . However , I now know that trying new things like him led to him as one of the successful people in the world , in invention . It is because he learned from his tryouts . He sometimes failed and succeed . When he failed , he learned why he failed from what he did by figuring out what went wrong , what needs to be improved , and so on . For example , he failed to hatch an egg because there is a certain conditions required to hatch an egg , the condition that hens have . On the other hand , when he succeeded , he become more confident encourage himself to try other things . Without these traits , he would not be one of the successful people . In business studies , I learned that it is one of the facts that a successful business person tries new things and take risks , which is fairly true . For example , if a person wants to start running a business in ice-cream market , he should have superior and interesting ideas that catch the attention of consumers . To find unique ideas , he tries new things such as making new flavours of ice-cream which people did n't taste before , making interesting shape of the ice-cream , and so on . Moreover , he should assume that he will be responsible for taking risks as he try new things . If his idea fails , then he should replace the financial problems resulted from the failure . However , as he get over these factors , he will later became a successful businessman in ice-cream industry . People want to be successful but it is true that most of them do n't know how to succeed . For them , I want to suggest to try new things and take risks , as statement said .
(KOR,medium) I disagree with the statement because taking risks is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many years . There are hundreds of companies I never heard of that were founded by a person took risks to make some money . Even though it may sound easy , but it is very complicated : dealing with employments , monthly or yearly payments , government taxes , etc . As the result , only a few companies or even no company will survive . The result makes many people become moneyless or deptors . Taking risks is not a good idea . Trying is not a bad thing , but risking is not a good thing . There are only a few people who succeeded by risking , while there are millions who unsucceeded by risking . That 's why people who only does what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risks . For example , early pioneers tried to make flying possible for humans . Of course , the inventors succeeded , but the others lost money , wasted time , or even died . But now billions of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplanes . How did that happen ? The manufacturing companies invented better airplanes , based on the early inventors ' designs . In other words , they invented what they already knew how to do well . Then the manufacturing company succeeded , selling thousands of the same model , for the same price , and ending what it 's like today . There are many successful people who tried new things and took risks . But there are more people who succeeded by not taking risks and only doing what they already know how to do well . Like I mentioned earlier , taking risks could change people 's lives in a bad way by making them lose money , or even killing them . But only doing what you already know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed .
(SPA,high) I disagree with the statement for many reasons but I must agree with the fact that a tour guide can provide useful information about certain places that you can visit and that you may not know about . I , being a very curious person , prefer to be left on my own to explore a certain place and learn about it by myself or at least accompanied by a friend or a family member . By exploring a tourist atraction by yourself such as an ancient palace or castle , for example , you could wind up discovering several curious nooks or rooms not offered in a normal touring schedule . If I 'm exploring a castle without the guidance of a tour guide , I might want to carry some sort of map or written information about the place so I can not only satiate my curiosity but also learn interesting facts in the process . A teacher of mine once told me an experience she had when she visited some turkish palace some time ago . She did not enjoy following the crowd of tourists around so she lagged behind of the tour group . As they found themselves in some room , she struck up a conversation with one of the gaurds . The gaurd liked her and told her that he could show her one of the rooms the `` regulars '' did n't have any access to . The gaurd took my teacher through a door into one of the most gorgeous gold-laminated , ruby-studded room she had ever seen . Tour guides can often be boring an monotonous and herd people along through different places as if they were a flock of sheep . They will give the usual tour to the usual type tourists , one after another , after another , after another . There is no dynamism involved in a guided tour , no interaction between the people , the guide and the location . It 's the same routine for the tour guide : look here , take a picture there , here X person died , room after room . By exploring a place on your own with a propper , written , guide you can learn a lot more and also enjoy some degree of independence . If I ever visit the chateaus of France or the pagodas in Japan , I would largely prefer to be left on my own to inspect and explore every hidden room , corner and passageway .
(KOR,medium) At the learning process wherever at school or homestudy , it is importand to teach students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Most students do n't like study math . Because students are used to study by fact . There is no active reaction during the class . The teachers write down the Roman numerals on the board and force students to memorize that There is no make sence why students should learn all about these kind of complicate questions . However , if they would have known , math is need when they have plan to get morgage for thier future house or to calculate the discount of the purchases at the store , it will be motivate to them to learnd math . As a student who study music composition , I have a class to write a fugue like Bach style . When I have a list of all the stuff of writing such as canon , imitation and inversion . I was so frustrated . Because those stuffs are not music , that is just fact which bach inventer to me . It does n't give any challenge . After the class . I go to library to find the real concept of writing a fugue . It is german word ; means one follows another or one trys to escape the direction from the other . It was understandable and give a mitivation to write a fugue . Why does n't fugue teacher explain the concept of the fugue ? Student want to know about the understand ideas more than the fact . Learning has to be full of will and purpose with a pleasure in student 's mind . The pleasure of learning came from knowing the ideas and concept . The fact is less important than that .
(GER,medium) First of all I want to say , what the question deals with . I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject . There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides . On my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledge of many subjects . The reason why this is on my opinion will be written down in the following text . First i want to say , that if you have a broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies . So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic . Maybe the company you want to be hired is searching for a person who knows things of every part of a firm . A reason can be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone . Then they can hire you for a work but if a person of another work is missed , you are able to do his work too . Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than specializing in one part . You should know everything about this part . I want to give an example . If you want to specalize in marketing , you have to know everything about it . You can only be hired in this part of a firm . And if you are not be needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked . But if you have the knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm . A third advantage of a broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things . you can learn new things in all parts of academic . It would be boring if you do the same things the whole of your life . A broad knowledge gives yiu the possibility that you can change yor work . Your life would be more exiting . To finish the text I want to give reasons why this is on my opinion . I am studying Buisness . But i am studying in all parts of buisness . so I can look with part will be good for me . Maybe i will specialize my knowledge later but i know many things of other academic parts too . So I will be more flexible than other workers later .
(TUR,high) In today 's world it is a debate if knowing more is better or specializing in a subject is better . To specizlize in a subject may make you an expert about that subject but knowing little from every subject makes you only knowledgable to some degree . Therefore the decision may depend on which one you value most . I would value to be an expert in my field . Knowing just a little about all subjects may give you the opportunity to talk about everything but when it comes to talking deeply , for example when somebody asks you about an important part that does not stand on surface , you may not be able to provide any answers . If you are specialized in the subject you will be able to give the answer . So having a broad knowledge of every subject may lead not knowing any subject fully . And if you have missing knowledge about that subject , I think if is better not to talk . You may be able to talk about the subject but when it comes to academic speechs , where you should show your knowledge about the topic , you may fail to give enough information . In my opinion if a person talks about a specific question he must be knowledgable about all aspects of the question . To be able to give specific and not very known facts is more important than repeating the facts that are known by many people . I think repeating would be what the ones who are not specialized in a subject will do . Moreover , today 's society gives more credit to specialized knowledge in work environments . Firms usually prefer to hire people that completed the undergraduate level and also completed a graduate level which had given them the opportunity to specialize in their subject . The ones who successfully completed a graduate degree , who are knowledgable about all aspects of their field of study , become the ones who are most valued in the work place . They can find jobs more easily and they are paid more . For these reasons people try to specialize in a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic skills . I would like to enjoy better working environments with earning more money and I would like to be able to talk about every aspects of my subject . For these reasons I think specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge about many subjects .
(ITA,high) I agree that most of the time advertisements make products seem better than they are and I guess there are several reasons for this . One of the main reasons is that in most cases , there are a number of similar products manifactured by different companies that are in competition for being bought by costumers . Usually costumers will want to choose the best product among the several similar ones , that is why each brand will try to convince potential buyers that his product is better than the others . For example , soaps and detergents to use in a washing machine . Every advertisement will show extremely dirty clothes become spotless and the more incredible the result is , the better the product is supposed to be . The point here is `` incredible '' : no product can actually do what is showed , but if company A did a sincere advertisement , nobody would buy A 's product because `` it does not clean clothes as good as the others do '' . That all comes down to a sort of `` prisoner 's dilemma '' from game theory . It is a bit like doping in some sports : if nobody used it , there would be a fair competition , but a single person who chooses not to use it puts itself at a great disadvantage towards the others . One other big reason for making products seem better than they are , is the need to create a desire in the potential costumer . The advertisement 's goal is to make people feel that a certain item is so good and useful that it is not possible to live without it . So , even if at first people would think of that object as unnecessary , after some time they will feel the need to buy it . An example might be cell phones : until ten or fifteen years ago very few people had a cell phone and the ones who did not , did not even think about buying one because it would have been useless . Now almost everybody has a cell phone , or even more than one , and they wonder how they did manage to live their lives without it .
(KOR,medium) When it comes to choosing whether you prefers broad range of knowledges or just one specialized knoweldge , there could be a lot of opinions just as different strokes for different folks . Some of my opposite numbers would try to win me over by saying ` One specialized knowledge is better ' . They would come up understandable reasons like ` If you tried to learn a lot of things at one time it will simply overwhelm your self and you may not be able to master just one knowledge pluently ' . Their reason is quiet acceptable and very tempting however if I am allow to choose one treasure from the various shiny ones I would claim my prize by saying ` I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ' . There are various reasons to support my idea . First our lives are limited to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a computer . So what I figure is if you have limited time to learn might as well learn much stuff as possible . The second reason is that we are living in fast evolving society and I think the era of one speciallized knowledge is over . People with broad range of knowledges are treated more nicer than people who just specialized in one academic subjects . Let me give you one example . In our country it is very hard to get a reliable job . We have to faster than others , smater than others , even richier than others . At the time like this specializing one academic subjects is like a sucide attempt because jobs are limited and companies are looking for more intelligent people . Come to think of it the idea which my opposite numbers are suggesting is very reasonable . But I think what they are claming is kind of far from the reality . Besides I do n't think my opinion is not a far cry from the given subject nethier . So in conclusion I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have just one specialized academic subject .
(GER,high) One can undoubtedly say , that everybody in our society strives for success . But what is the underlying principle leading to success ? Some people claim that successful people are innovative , take risks rather than continuing working on what they already know well . In my opinion , this statement is true for many cases . People who try new things or take risks are more willing to explore their boundaries . This makes it more likely to come accross discoveries and ideas that are revolutionary and lead to and outstanding performance . Also , these people are usually more adaptable than their collegues who prefer to stick to their old patterns and spend their entire life in an office , performing the same tasks everyday . Risky people are usually at the forefront of their field , whereas people who do what they know well , will always lag behind . People who are open-minded perceive changes in their environment not as a threat , but as an opportunity and are able to take these chances to revolutionise an area . Furthermore , people who are willing to take risks cannot usually be discouraged easily by concerned friends or family when trying to set a very far-fetched idea into practice . A classic example of how being innovative lead to huge success is the story of a man working for a computer firm . This company had been specialised on the production of huge computers for a long time . This employee had the idea to build portable computers ( i.e. laptops ) . However , his idea was rejected by his boss . As a consequence , the employee resigned from his job and set up a company who built laptops . As we know today , his idea had been a huge success - and the company still suffers from being reluctant to adopt to this change . Critics on the other hand may say that there is no recipe to success . Just being bold and trying new things does not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome . Also , moving too far away from ones 's initial area of studies means that a lot of time must be invested in learning new techniques and theories , as many field require a substantial background knowledge in order to work in them . This , indeed , is a valid argument . However , as mentioned previously the attitude of people who are prepared to take risks is much more likely to lead to an outstanding discovery . Clearly , there is no guarantee for success , but as the previous examples have illustrated , only people who are willing to take risks and search for the unexplored are likely way to become very successful .
(HIN,medium) Each and every person likes to enjoy life . Some think that young people enjoy life more than older people while some may think the opposite . Different individuals have different views . In my view young people enjoy life more than older peole do but not always . Young people are full of energy and enthusiatic . They like to enjoy each and every moment of life . They are usually fit and fine as compared to older people . So they have the energy to enjoy each and every moment . Young people usually watch movies , play sports or even make girlfriends to entertain themselves . They feel that this is the only age to enjoy , so they try to take full out of it . They consider this age as if the age of entertainment and adventure . Old people on the other hand are too weak to entertain themselves by playing sports or by going for a adventurios trip . They also watch movies very rarely and only few of them make girlfriends at this age . Most of the time they remain ill and complain about their health . Older people often like company of others , if they are alone they might feel disconnected from the world and the enthusiasm to enjoy the life dies gradually . As i stated above that young people enjoy life more than older people but not always . Young people have many tensions regarding their education and career , so they cannot enjoy the life at its full . Older people on the other hand are free from tension , so they can enjoy the life at its best . Young people often think about their career and remain involved in their regular curricular or business activities and are not able to deliver appropriate time for enjoyment or pleasure . So it can be said that young people enjoy life more than the older people but not always and not in all situations as this is the age when they have to plan for their entire remaining life .
(SPA,medium) The understanding of both ideas and contents are important . There is therefore , a slight difference for me that makes one more important than the other . First of all when we learn about facts , whe are using our memory to get some info on somethig that works , exists and does not require any further experiments or resaerches . On the other hand , when students learn concepts and ideas , they may put them together with the pourpose of conducting some researches . When students are curious and have enough information , concepts and ideas ; the results of their experimets could lead them to get some facts by themselves . Thomas Edison for example did not have the fact about what light represented , he had lots of ideas and concepts as the result of his various researches . He was curious enogh to be able to put all these factors together ( Curiosity , ideas , concepts ) to be able to make a wonderful , revolutionaty invention . An invention that created many everlasting facts . All the modern and the new school methods zero in on leading the student to the learning through his ideas and the curiosity these may generate on him . Nowadays , I have also have the chance to test myself and put into practice all these methods . I am a person who likes learning through experiences and getting plenty of information by myself . Achieving facts , or learning about facts on my own is important for me , but needless to say that all the existing facts you may learn about also give us abundant richness of concepts , ideas and kwoledge . In short , ideas , concepts and facts are all necessary , but what really makes the difference is how effective well - structured concepts can lead a student to a more self-exploratory environment . Thank you .
(ARA,high) The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one . Some people find it to be beneficial , and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging . I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better . The reasons for my belief are the following : First , traveling with a tour guide is more informative , since the guide has all the information about the place , and should be able to answer any question . He has also visited the place many times , and knows all the interesting places to be seen . I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country 's culture , than if he was to travel by himself . I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey , and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full , I got to know most of the turkish culture . One of the things I wo n't forget , is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding . It was a very interesting thing to see . Second , the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group . In this schedule the group gets to see the most important , famous , and interesting places in the country being visited , probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of , or could not have planned such a schedule . I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide . Another reason , is the financial reason , usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers . Third , I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country , and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone . When visiting a new place , a person does not know the safe places , or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood . These details , which are of great importance , are taken care of by the tour guide . For all of the reasons , I mentioned above I believe that it is a much safer , and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide , if of course traveling to a country for the first time .
(ITA,high) Technology has been constantly improving over time . This process seems not to be slowing down , especially because people 's needs increase rapidly , and advances in technology are an important factor in the production of highly demanded goods . Obviously , cars are one of those . Each family owns at least one car , and people use it to go everywhere , even when it is not strictly necessary . In some countries , places are reachable on walking distances , but in others people would not be able to go anywhere without an automobile . this is one of the main reasons we depend so much on cars , and i find it hard to believe that some day we will be able to give up on them . On the other hand , the number of cars around increases incredibly every day , and we should consider the possibility that - as time passes - it could get quite difficult to drive around because of traffic . Roads would be overcrowded , and it could be impossible to move freely and quickly from one place to another . Besides that , a shortage of gas availability could occur , and this would definitely have a bad impact on our economy . In my view , it is very likely to happen that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are nowadays . i am positive that technology will give us many more products whose main purpose will be making our lives even more comfortable than they already are . Moreover , a more moderate use of cars would benefit the environment , and people will learn to use public transportation more often in order to live better . we only need to get used to live without a car , and then we may even forget about it completely !!!
(ARA,low) i agree on that in the future ( around twenty years ) cars will be fewer , because other kind of transportation will improve and will be more easyer . for instant using trains with a fast speed and has many different stations will make man be more comfurtabule using it rather then his/her oun car . also buses can give a big comfurtabule life for peaple . because peaple will not have to think about parking or even taking care of thier cars or any other careness . in addition , number of peaple will increase in the future , that will cause a lot of traffic and air pullotion . so i think using other transportation other thene cars will give a big help for peaple to get to other places without any problems as mentioned above . therfor , i beleive human will begin to egnore cars and try to depend on more easeir and more comfurtabule tranportations to live a better , comfurtabule , cleaner life .
(CHI,medium) Will there be fewer cars on road twenty years later than there are today ? This is complex and controversial question . But in my opinion , I do agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . My opinion will be proved by following discussion . First of all , the traffic jam . Traffic jam already became a serious problem in any large cities in the world . For example , Shanghai , It will take you 2 hours to go 3 miles during the peak time . Government tried to build more roads but still can not meet the requirement . The solution is the rail way transportation system . This is also the solution for many other cities in the world . Take subway , you can control the time accurately and will not waste your time on road . If more and more people take the public transportation system such as subway , there will less cars on road . Secondly , the environment protection . More and more people and governments in this world already awared that protect our environment is protecting our selves . Also , more and more people select other transportation systems such as bicycle , electrical powered trains and solar powered systems instead of a car . People is choosing not to use cars as possible as they could . This trend means that there will be less cars on road in future than there are today . Third , resource shortage and government policy . As we know that the price of the oil always keep going up recently . This is because the oil has already became the shortage resource . If the price continue going up , less people could affort the consumption of oil and will stop use the car . Also , to solve the traffic jam problem and resource shortage problem , the governments will issue different kind of policies to limited the use of car . For example , raise the tax of car and oil , or raise the car license fee which already selected by Shanghai government few years ago . People have to pay extra money to support a car in future . This will force a lot of people not to use the car . In the end , base on above mentioned reasons , we could draw the conclusion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
(TEL,medium) Whenever there is a lecture beign given , the students often get involved with the subject that they start implementing the ideas and start developing few analyzstions regarding the teachings , but hardly try to understand the facts behind them , basically the originality of the subject . even though the facts are retold most of them try to repose them and concentrate on the concept . the fact is that both the concepts and theory of the facts are important . it is thinking and implementing some ideas about what is beign understood and developing the idea to make it real , this theory drives behind the knowledge of understanding and knowing facts . many of them are interested in knowing the facts behind everything ( afterall , who does n't want to know the reason behind each matter or say topic ) . this also may depend on the persons desire to use the facts in understanding the topic . the differences in a study may be figured out due to the lack of facts known regarding that particular field . though the reasons may be figured out , the fact is that learning through the new ideeas and the concepts are very much preferred by most of the future students , may be this ids the like of the newer generation . for example , when a theory of pendulum is taught in a class the students do try to learn the principle of it but are least interested ( atleast Galileo ) in how it happened to be seen light , and again it is a different story . the students start developing their ideas on the concept taught to them and start working to create or say invent something that is based on the principle of pendulum . the same goes with the very popular Newton-apple tree story . many theories have seen light after the principle of gravity is given byt he great Newton . thereb are many instances that go in the same path , likeBohrs atomic theory , Rutherfords . not only in the field of learning but also in the field of research these things do apply . although the research feild require sthe students to remember the names of thescientists they do it for the namesake , but are rather interested in their researches . finally , not only me but most of them would agree that the students are intended to get to nstudy the concepts , undersatnd them and thus leading to the better results . although there may be a piont raised that the facts are a must for experiecing the situations and circumctances , it may be obvious that it goes thgrough the old saying `` failure ( s ) are the steps to success '' , wherein the students do try out getting new things and fail but rejuvinate with a roaring success . I think for such things the need of facts to be known is not a of great help but finding out something new does make the joy double , encouraging , therefore , the future studentd
(HIN,high) Technology has revolutionized our lives i.e. the way we live , the way be preceive .. Everything has changed with the advent of modern innovations . We have become accustomed to this technology in our everyday lives be it a referigerator , washing machine , radio etc . In fact it is impossible to think life without these things . Modern technology has given us pace . It has developed modern means of transport for fast movement . The cars , trains and areoplanes etc all are gifts of technology Cars . This is a quite familiar name in day to day life . In fact every middle class home owns atleast one car , Car has become more of a necessity in today 's life . Moreover , to a some degree it also has become a sort of status commodity . But that does not hide the imprtance of cars in in our day to day life . In life where time is everything cars are one of the fastest means of transport . Cars are required at family outings . Thus car is an indispensable part of our day to day life . But , although technology has aided us , it is also leading to dangerous results . Take for an instance , technology has made living more comfortable resulting in decline in health problems and cosequently increase in population . Thus this large population is a large pressure on our resources . Our oil resources are depleting at a rapid rate and perhaps be exhausted in another thirty years or so . With their exhaustion , cars , which run on petrol , will be of no use to us Thus declining resources has forced us to look for alternatives which employ better utilization of these resources . Thus the railways , trams come into picture . In fact twenty years will now , there will be fewer cars in use then there are today . With the scarcity of petroleum products , it would become quite difficult to afford a car at that time . The people will go for cheaper means of transport . Now a days people has become aware of this thing and already have started using public transport more often . Thus the car purchase has fallen . In twenty years time the existing cars would be disposed off due to the finishing of their utilization period . This will also see an decline in number of cars . Thus it has been clearly proved in the passage that with declining petroleum products , car quantities would fall in the time period to come
(TUR,high) Life is a journey from birth to death . Through this journey , a person experiences many things . But when it comes to enjoying life , certain qualities of a person affects the level of enjoying . One of this qualities is person 's age . And I think , the less your age is , the more you enjoy life . That is , young people enjoy life more than older people do . First reason that comes to my mind why youth is more enjoyable is because you are healthier when you are young . If you are not healthy nothing can cheer you up as much as it is supposed to . It is obvious that when you get old , health problems begin to lower your satisfaction from life . And also the things to stay healthy get harder to make , for example , sports . In addition to health problems , the fear of death begins to bug your mind more often when you get old . When a person is young he/she rarely thinks about death , because it seems far away from him/her as if it would never ring his/her door . Existence of this fear makes life less enjoyable than it was when he/she was young . Hope is a very important thing when it comes to enjoying life . Hope makes you to gain the power needed to struggle with the problems of life . Thanks to the many years ahead of the young person and relatively bad experiences , he/she keeps his/her hope more easily than an experienced old person . Hope may not be necessarily result in a desired situation but the hope itself makes life more enjoyable . Lastly , as a more personal opinion : If I was an old person I would be sad that I wo n't be able to see the possible advancements in world . For example , I can predict that we will be able to see man like robots in twenty-thirty years . Having the possibility to see these advancements make life more enjoyable for me .
(JPN,medium) I agree the idea that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , becasue I have three models of the successful people . First , one of the three successful people is my old brother . When he was a junior high schoo student , he did not like to study very well . He did not study , so his grade was not good . But one day , he met a high school teacher in the town . Then he thought I want to be his student , so I want to take the his school entrance exam . But the school study revel is high . I should study hard . After my brother met the teacher , he studied very hard . So he could get better grade than before , and he could be one of a student of the teacher 's high school . Second , one of the three successful people is Mr. Toyota . He created the big and famous car company in Japan . I think the company was one of the famous car companies in the world . When he was a child , his family was poor . Becasue he must help to his family in his child age , he could not get studying oppotunity well . His father 's job was small bike store , so when he graduate junior high school , he was president of the small company . Then he created idea of corporation like big american trrain comopanies . The idea was very big risk then , becasue it was not common idea in Japan . Today , his company became a big company . Third , one of the three successful people is Syoinn Yoshida . He was one of the most famous people in Japan . He was teacher in MEIJI era . When he was teacher , he thought Japan should learn from other contories like England or America . But then people , who go to abroad without permittion from government , was very big crime . But he tried to go to America . He swam to the America 's big boart at the night . And he tried to go to America . But then american officer did not permit because America did not want to attack . But the story made Japan courage .
(GER,high) I agree with the statement , that there will be fewer cars in twenty years for the following reasons : The first reason is that the price of petroleum is still rising in the long-term , because crude oil is getting more rare . So , because the price of petroleum is getting higher , driving is getting more expensive over time . In twenty years , the price of petroleum will be much more higher than today . Maybe , the cars then will receive their power of other raw materials , but today , it is not sure that there will be a substitute for petroleum in twenty years , which is as functional as petroleum . Another argument for the decline of cars are cities . Because people still migrate from the countryside to cities , they are getting bigger and bigger all over the world . As the cities are growing , the traffic chaos is growing too . Today , in many cities it is much cheaper and faster to use the public transportation such as metro and busses . This effect will get stronger over the years as the cities are growing . The other point is , that less people will live at the countryside , in regions , where a car is a necessarity for the daily life . The pollution of the environment is the third reason why the amount of cars will be smaller in twenty years . As long there is no other source of power invented , petroleum will be used in cars . But in these days the concern about the environmental changes in the last years are getting bigger and it is proved that the burning of petroleum contributes to some effects for example the lightening of the ozon . So probably stronger environmental laws will be made , which could have affects on the amount of cars driven if they make it more difficult or more expensive to drive . Because of the reasons given , I think that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
(ARA,medium) Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree with this statement because evereyone now only care of hisself and do not think of others , others is represent their communities . Everyone have a community to live in , but do not give it enough time to helping . What is your community ? Your community is representing you . If you do not give you community a time to help you are even do not help yourself . You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community , you community will develope so you will develope and you will think better to have a very good and connected community . Why young people do not give their community enought time to helping . I think that they do not think of this or this thing even do not come to their mind . For example my cousion he work very hand to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy of what he done but he did not think that he can get his community time to help . maybe if he think they will help and this is why do not young people give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities . Communities is the more important thing or the first thing in young people life than other thing because you are growing and stating your life with helping from you community and you must try to give a time to helping your communities . In my conclusion , i thing that we must remind a young people and try to help them and give them solutions that will help them inorder to help them to help their community .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities resently . These days , many young people do not care about their communities and even they do not know what is happenning in their comunities . I have some experiences which made me feel that some of young people do not care about their comunities . It was a few weeks ago that We have the day to collect trash in my community . I paticipated in it with my friend . We were gathered at a park . Can you imagin how many young people came to the park ? There are only five youg people including me and my friend . Later , I asked some of my friends why they did not come . They said that they did n't have time because they was hanging out with their friends or watching TV at their home . Some of them even did n't know about it . I was surprised at these reasons since i did n't realize that so many people do not care about the comminuty . Also , last year , I was asked to help a festival which was held in my community but I could n't help because I had some things had to do , so I asked some of my friends to help it instead me . However , nobady accepted to do it because they may get tired . As a result , I help the festival . I think there are some problems caused by actions of those who do not give enough time to helping their communities . If more young people help their community , we can make community more great and good for all of us .
(SPA,high) Well , I dont think success is a resultant of experiencing risks . Risk may help to prove oneself new ways of doing things ; new possibilities to aboard issues or face fears and conventionalities . But I really dont think that by taking risks one can assure for its life success . The main problem that I detect on the statement is that the concept of success is limited to the risk one . Fisrt of all we should define what those terms stand for in modern society in order to really understand what are the possibilities involved in that particular process . For instance , I could be very succesful without risking anything in my life . I may have proven formulas that have worked for me all my life and that not necessarily make me a succesful person in terms of money and fame , but in my own reference terms , that could be anything regarding a good quality of life , or even not simply that . If we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern societies that succes may bring to a person , the arguments would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame . So , why is money and fame the two main references to explain succes from my point of view ? Because those concepts are the ones that prevail in modern capitalist societies . Yes , capitalism , far from all the so-called economic benefits that it supposes for mankind , it has also produced a terrible social need for material whealt in order to expose social status and succes . I may finish my toughts on this topic by referencing the one and only clue to understand postmodernity : `` the more you buy , the more you are ''
(TEL,high) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I agree with the issue stated above . The detials and examples listed below states my view on this issue . Its a known fact that cars accomodate fewer people when comapred to busses and trains . lets us say for example there are 100 passengers for all these persons in order to accomodate a bus requires 2 busses in case of a car the number is large say around 25 cars . we have to use fuel in order to run these cars and busses . compare the fuel that is wasted when we use 2 busses and 25 cars the fuel wastage is heavy when we use cars . So that we can save some fuel for future generations . Another reason is that as more cars are moving there will be more amount of pollution on the earth the pollution in turn effects health of many people . for example some cities in italy celebrate one day in a year as cars day on that day no car will be in the streets the main purpose of this is to celebrate one day with out pollution which clearly state that riding more number of cars will have a devastating effect on the environment and the fuel prices are increasing rapidly it is very difficult for common people to maintain a car so they wo n't use a car frequently . The other reason is that in these present days global warming has increased rapidly which means the temperature on the earth surface is increasing rapidly this cause melting in polar ice caps if it happens so many of the parts in this world will be submearged . Of course cars are not only the means that are causing this however if we reduce the usage of cars we can reduce it somehow . So in future government of various countries will took necessary steps to use fewer cars . In conclusion cars are not only the only means for transportation but there are some other means of transport which can be used by the public in effective ways so fuel can be saved for the future generations . Hence after twenty years fewer cars will rum on the road .
(SPA,medium) The issue at hand is the amount of cars that we are going ti have in the future i am totally agree with the satatement that in the future there is going to be a fewer amount of cars than we have today . the firs argument thet i have to agree with this is because today there are a lot of tecnologycal developments , this means that transportation companies universities and also the goverment are trying to research and find diferentes ways of transportation such as fast trains , faster ferries and others . All this with the idea of cleaning the streets of the huge ammounts of cars that only mke noise and traffic congestion . because this tecnologycal developments i thin in the future there will be a few number of cars . additionaly we have to consider the importance of internet on this days this importance is leading us to take onlines courses at the university this means non presential classes , and also there are long donstances jobs , for example you can work in a call center but from your house . the increasing ammount of this kind of jobs demostrate that in the future wiil not need to cross long distances to make our life therefore we are not going to need a car . thus i think there are going to be less cars due to the the ideas that we are not goin to need it . Finally a think there are a lot of enviromental issues every day people is more consient that we have to take care of our enviroment so for that reasons they prefer another kind of transportation and think to take a train or subway is a beeter idea . then tecnoly developments , internet and online work growing an enviromental issues make me think that the satement that in twenty years there is going to be fewer cars than today is valis and i am agree with it .
(HIN,medium) Yes i agree with the statement , because Logic of the car in a city is always based on the fact that there is a fuel present in , on which it can run . So the basic fact should be that - presence of fuel in abundance . But that is not the case , as we all know fuel ( petrol , diesel ) are non renewable souces of energy . The fuel takes thousand of years ro come in to being , but they are reducing faster as compare to their presence with us . so in return their prices are increasing day by day . And people have already started taking for different alternatives like CNG ( compressed natural gas ) , LPG ( liquified petroleum gas ) . But the irony is that these options are also non renewable . So somewhere down the line the prices of fuel wether in any form which i have talked about will be so high that middle class and upper middel class will not be able to afford it and hence they will use public transport to commute . SO that class vehicles will not be prent on roads wether car or two weheeler . After sometime say 10 yrs more the fact will hit the upper class too and we will not have any car or vehicle on road . The time line about this danger , which i have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can have even calculations about it if he/she has both the population and existing fuel count . They should also have the rate at which fuels are getting depleted . So the best way to tackle the proablem is to find out renewable source of energy through which one can commute to different places . Surely the work has already been started , because the affect of this fear is already noticable in the current scenario .
(ARA,medium) I totally agree with this statment and i blieve that every thing in our world has its own advantages and dis advantages and so does advertsment . Advertisment means announcing about some thing wheather it is good or bad . but comercially ; you do not have to show the bad qualities of your product other wise peapole will not buy it for example if you advertised that your product is not suitable for olders also the youth will not buy it so you have to lie and say it is suitable for all people to give it the chance to compete you have to say that your product is tcken rapidly to incourage people to try it while in fact it is stored in all shopps Once I bought ashirt and it was advertised that absorbs sweat without harming the skin but after only one day i suffered from allergy up to two monthes after that irealized that it was not made from cotton but from pollyester Once again I bought a pincil and it was advertised that it will last with you for at least one year but unfortunately it was brocken at the same day So finally I agree with the statment above and recommened all people NOT TO RELY ONLY ON ADVERTISMENTS
(KOR,medium) I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . If the advertisements fail to show the products ' virtue , why are the manufacturers advertising their products every day ? It is the basic function of the advertisement . Comercials are trying to exaggerate the virtue of products in two ways . First , using the characteristics of media . Television , newspaper , and megazine are adapting every possible visual effects on their advertisements in order to show the products brighter than they are . They using lightings and computer based image reprocessing technoligies . There are lots of new thechnoligy used in the advertisements that makes it possible products can be seen as totally different styles and shapes . Hence , customers usually disappointed with the real shape and color of the products , Especially for economic product with ceap materials . Second , showing just good part of the products . Even though the advertisement do not lie to customers , exposing only the good part of products means hiding the worse part of the products . Hence , if the public see the advertisements , they may think the products are amazing one without any problem . It is the reason why some sophisticate customers try to find rates of other customers for the product they plan to buy . The customers who already used the products can give more accurate information , both pros and cons . It means customers hardly find bad aspects of the products on their comercials . In conclusion , I strongly agree with the idea that advertisemens makes products seem much better than they really are . Although advertisements of products can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customers with wrong images .
(ITA,medium) Personally i completly agree with this statement . Not only i think this statement is true , but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act . I 'm sure that one of the most important guideline to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful , first of all you have to spent a lot of it ! All the successful people such as factory owners , broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evoluting their companies and buying or creating new ones . I also think that one of the most important thing for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money , of course , we all know that `` money makes the world go around '' , but also for a feeling of desiring power ! It really does n't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached ... keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives . I can pick up a very well known example of a person which has been really successful : Silvio Berlusconi . The intention is not to discuss about he 's politic ideas , but to analyse goals a person has reached . A man which has always lived following this principle . At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developping new companies . Some of these always in the field of media , but some not , like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago . Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates . Can you imagine if he would have stopped creating and inventing computer softwares after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway . Probably we would be now less evoluted . Bill Gates is that kind of example that makes me think that this risking , sometime innovative and brave people are , in some occasions , also very important for the evolution of mankind itself .
(KOR,high) Nowadays , we sometimes go on a trip . There are two methods to travel such as travelling by alone or group . Some people assert that travelling in a group is not a perfect idea . However I maintain that I can get various benefits to travel in a group : not expensive cost to travel and apportunity to share information . First , I can enjoy traveling by cheap price . Traveling costs is very high nowadays . Because , if we go abroad , we could take an airplain . However if I can go the travel in a group , we can save some money . There are some rules that If taking it more than 10 people , airplain company would cut prices . This situation is same as hotel and entrance fees . For example , I went to Europe last summer in a group . I went there during 15days and it was good aportunity for me . On the other hand , one of my friend also went to Eurpople in same periods . Eventohght we visited there same peiods and same date , we had a lot of differences in costs . I only costed about 300 $ , but my friens costed 500 $ . Second , I can get various information in travelling group . Visiting other countries are advantures . If you could have not visited at once , you would felt embarrased . However you can enjoy clean , safe and informative travel in group . For me , It was first time to go abroad . So I felt scared sometimes . Also I did not know what I was going to do . At that time , I did not have enough information to enjou it . By using travel agency , I could book airplains and hotels . Also I could have a lot of information about Europe . There were many people in that group , so it was available to contact them and share information and know-how which they recognized from travelling . Eventhoug we should follow travel agency 's rule , I think it would be a good idea following in a group . It would be a good apportunity to using small amout of money , to expand your experience as well as to get much information .
(KOR,medium) I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . People usually buy for looking the products which have good looking shape . The customers cannot test the products before using it except special events , so the people who make the advertisements pay attention about making good and charming advertisements . These are the specific reasons what I agree with the statement First , customers want to be a model who shows in the advertisement . Everybody wants to be a nice guy or a beautiful woman instead of being ugly people . As a result , the people who make the advertisesements make this kind of advertisements . For example , If the TV shows very charming hair shampoo advertisement , the model in the advertisement has very beautiful blond straight hair , it blows by the wind and it looks really nice . If I have think , curly black hair , I can not be as a woman who are in the advertisement . Second , customers do not know its value exactly . Just to see an advertisement , the customers never know about its value , since they never tried it before . Even if the product has very poor value , the customers never know about it before using it . So , the people who make the advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are . Third , customers easily lose their sights about judging the advertisement . While they are watching the advertisements , they easily lose their minds which they already know about the fake of the advertisements . Because of this reason , the workers who work for the advertisement company are trying to make the products seem much better that they really are . For these reasons ; people want to be a cool person , people do not know the product 's value , and people can easily lose their sight about the capacity to judge the advertisements , we should think about the advertisements . People should aware to watching the advertisements and think again about the products that the people are willing to buy .
(TEL,high) * In my opinion it is better to specialize on one subject rather than many academic subjects but at the same time we should have a little basic knowledge about the other subjects too . It is always better to have an indepth knowledge about one particular subject and be an expert in it or else the person will obiviously be `` Jack of all and master of none '' . Having indepth knowledge in a particular subject will obviously make a person skilled in that field and he / she can concentrate and contribute the best towards that particular subject . I agree that the world today is rapidly progressing in every field . I however totally donot deny that we should not have any knowledge about any other subject rather the the one in which we are specializing because the world is growing too fast and if we are not aware of the developments taking place then we will obviously be like a frog in a well . A person has to be dynamic enough and should be aware of all the fields and shouldnt be an alien to a new subject . A dynamic person in my opinion is a person who should be able to talk about the computers at the same time should also know what the green house effect is . Given a little math we should be able to that as well because these are the basics which every person has to know . We humans are social beings and when move around in society we meet people from different fields . When we converse with each other we should be able to converse on any subject though we may not essentially be an expert in it . I would like to conclude saying a person should have a sound knowlegde of every subject but at the same time he should also be an expert in one subject atleast .
(SPA,medium) Definitly , people who is successful take their life in continuos challenge . Sometimes , someone ask why he / or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I ca n't . In my opinion , the answer is very simple . It is neccessary work very hard for get my goals . People successful have three esential characteristics that the frustrated people not . The first is take risk all the time , second they are confident in themself and the last they are positive . First , people successful said yes for almost everything to do ! . For example , I was working in a project in the laboratory of pathology , but a partner to my field inviting to work in a different project . I worked with him without though in the inconvenients to result . when I accepted , I meant to studied harder and long hours to compensate my deficiencies in something new . However , I did and we finished the project and published it . Secondly , usually these people are confident in themself . They do n't feel scare to begin something . In fact , they always are in continuing challenge and never think in fail . They know very well their limits and capabilities . In addition , these charachteristic let them to work in best advantages than the rest of people . For instance , I followed the trayectory to famous basketball player . He knew his capability and deffects better than anyone , so he worked specifically in his deffects until he improved . As result , he was the best basketball player to the year . This point is relevant for being successful , if I know my limitations . I need to work harder all the time with it . Third , being positive is giving to me an excellent capacity to learning useful things for my goals . In other words , I can get fails , but I take it , such experience for try again . In short , I agree with the statement people successful have to be confident , positive and be anger to take risk always .
(ITA,medium) I think that young people today have a lot of time for all . Today generally a child has a good family , a good clean house with a beautiful garden , he has money and much time , generally a good situation around himself . The tipical day of the young people is more or less this : First , the young people today go to school in the first part of the day , they stay in classroom for 4/5/6 hours and then they are freedom . Second , in the first part of the aftenoon they make a homework for a small time and then ? They play football or go out for a shopping time or play with a bad machine that they call play station for all time and they do n't observe the world around us . And so in this days the youth lives and the time pass . In the world , a lot of countries are in difficolt . Only the 8 % of the global people live like a normal people but the most part of the global people died for no food or no water . This is a great vision of the world situation but in every city there are some problem that young people could to see and help . Every communities organize the groups to bring food to the people without home or a poor people in general in the street or for organizes the local events to stay together for few good moments . But the young people have a better thing to do . In my personal experience I think that help my comunity is good , some people are in difficolt for eat or sleep and with my group of friends we helping this people . When ? When we are free , after school or after homework . I do n't spent my time in a bad way I want to help someone . Finnally I hope that in the world much more people helping their society with their time with their money and with their love .
(GER,medium) In my opinion this statement is true . I think this is since young people are at the beginning of there lives and not in the middle or at the end of it . You can reccognise it if you start a new work . Generally at the beginning it is interesting , because you have never done it before , but after a few weeks or month you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting . Here are some examples why from my point of view , young people enjoy it more to live than old people . When you are young you have a lot of changes . You grow up , become interested in the other sex and have to go to school . You have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not . It does not care you . On the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there lives . The most grown up people I know , have a house or an appartement somewhere , children and a job . Those people have really not a lot of changes in there lives . The time schedule is nearly every week the same . However I know some other peoples who have a completly different way of live . For example one guy I know , he is 50 years old now , stopped to work with fourty . He has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live . So he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world . He works from time to time if he can at a bare in Jamaica , but only one ore two months in a year . I think in his case the mentioned statement is wrong . He never stoped to be young . I think that he enjoys everz daz like it would be his first on this planet . With this sentence I would like to say that the sentence wich I am writing about is not absolutely true . However generally I have the same impression .
(GER,medium) Everybody knows the problem with traffic jam and the more time you need to get from one point to another because of that . Reason for that is the increasing amount of cars in the industrial countrys . Nowadays nearly every household has one or more cars . The new drivers with eigthteen years get immediatly a car . In the same way the use of other traffic possibilitys such as the bus or a train goes back . But what will be in the future . Will there be more cars or not ? There are several reasons to suppose there will be more cars in the future for instance the faster creation and building of new car modells . The high variation of cars increases the choice and let the prices fall down . It is becoming easier to buy a car because there are many suppleys for the customers to finance a new car . To own a car is getting more and more important for work and also for prestige . Furthermore it is less expencive to go by car then by train or bus even if the petrol prices have raised very much during the last years . On the other hand people want to save their environment more and more . One step towards that is not to make so much dirt . Cars are still not very environmental friendly . When the petrol is burned many dangerouse toxics occures . Beneath the climbing rate of cars also the environmental awarness in the minds of the people increases . That could be a reason why they could change to puplic traffic again or share their cars with family members or friend . The automobile sector works against this end . All the cars are getting more friendly for the environment and they use less petrole than in former times . There are even cars that works with solar cells . To conclude you must say that the amount of cars directly depends on the technology
(ITA,high) In today 's world , a successful individual is someone that has achieved a goal in his life , who 's happy with what he has accomplished , with what he owns and has reached a high level of well-being . Everything seams perfect , but this also raises a question : Can a successful person desire more to what he already has ? Will he try to have new experiences and take risks ? I believe there can be two answers to this question . First of all I must agree with the statement that a successful man is going to search for new accomplishments and experiences because otherwise his existence becomes meaningless , and his journey through life would become repetitive and boring . A person eventually adapts to what he owns and to the situation that he lives in and is suddenly going to expect new things to occur , and wish for new events . I believe it 's in the nature of man to desire new things , a man is always trying to satisfy his desires and when they are indeed satisfied , he 'll have new desires . It 's a cycle . However I can also disagree with the previous statement because trying new things and taking risks depends also a lot on the individual 's character . I believe a man has to be confident with himself and his abilities if he wants to try new adventures . He has to be courageous and responsible to take risks . In conclusion i both agree and disagree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks .
(HIN,low) yes , I agree that young people do not give enough time for healping communities they remain envolved in other activities such as sports . children should take part in development of communities as they are future of our country . if community would develop our country wiil also develop then only people could get some work and we would be able to compare our country with developed countries . we should keep our sourrounding cleen in order to help our communities . it is true saying by some one that '' child is a father of an old man '' if children would help communitis from now in future it would be beneficial for them only . if there socities are well mantained and free from all kind of pollution all humanbeings living around them will remain healthy . As all of us know that cleaniness is very important . cleaness safe time as well as money because if know one is in bad health no doctor or medical fees would be paid . So if achild remain fits he can engoy his life so its important for achild to help his or her communities .
(ARA,high) Travelling around the world is a very interesting and educating experience . In order to fully enjoy the trip , we should decide wether to travel alone or in a group led by a tour guide . Actuallty , i prefer such organized tripes rather than travelling by my self for several reasons . The first reason is the positive impact of having a tour guide . Tour guids are very well educated about the historical , and cultural background of the places the group is visiting . Therefore , the tourists get more knowledge and deep explanations of what they see , especially in historical attractions . As the result , the trip becomes much valiable . For example , i travelled to a great historical place in Egypt and the tour guide was very helpful to explain every tiny detail of the temples . I think i would have not been able to get such huge amount of information if i just traveled alone . Another advantage of having a tour guide is that he or she can help tourists find good places for shopping by suggesting certain shopping areas . The second reason is the advantage of having a group . People from different countries , backgrounds , and experiences are travelling together does have a positive impact . For example , i had a trip two years ago with a group and i learned alot from them talking about their countries and the best places they saw in other trips . i gained valuable inormation about places i wanted to go and had not enough information to help me . Moreover , i can benefit from a group rate while going for shopping with the organized trip . The prices will be cheaper , so that i can buy more things . In conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . Spending the trip withe experienced tour guide as well as a whole group of people , will give a great oppportunity to learn more in an informal and interesting environment . The trip will be diffenitly more valuable if it is spent with such great accompany .
(CHI,medium) I would agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . There is a saying that `` Experience is the best teacher '' . A person who is very successful must experience more in different ways and learn how to survive in different environment and not afraid of risks . I will explain my opoins from the following aspects . First of all , one of the most important character that a successful person should have is curiousity and a desire about learning new things . Normally a new opportunity , new atmosphere and new people around can bring new sense and new pentientail for a person . For example , a very famous Chinese writer Lu Xun . He used to be a doctor , but he realized that doctor can only treat people 's sick instend of thinking . So tried to start writing article and book , then his books influenced a generation of Chinese in 1920s . Secondly , as a successful person , he must be very brave and taking risks in all different circumstances . For example , Chairman Mao is a tipical successful leader who was always taking risks in this world . He led Chinese people to stand up and build a new country in the east Asia . Thirdly , I do n't think that a person who always keeps a position and never try new things in his life will be successful . Keeping doing one thing for long time , people will become lazy and increative . They just want to do the daily things and never think about do some different from others . On the other hand , I also think that persistance is an very important character that a successful person should have . For example , a scientist is doing lots of study and research focusing on specific fields and progects . The job itself requires that he must know how to deal with his study and also must know how to do well . It is essencial for a scientist that he must be pacient and concentrate on something instead of trying new things and taking risks . In a nutshell , the successful people should have an couragement and disire for trying new things . It is an important part for a successful person to take risks in order to get new opponities and petential so that he can make a difference in this worls .
(ITA,low) Today people , especially young people , enjoy more then older people . I think it is a very true statement ! For example in my family i often go out at the saturday night , i usually go to the movies , to pubs or to the restaurant ! Instead my parents never go to the restaurant or to the movies ! I think it happens for several possible reasons . One possible reason is that the life today is earier than before . Today we often have a lot of money . My mother usually tell me that when she was young she has only two or three dress . I think it is incredible ! I have a huge amount of dress ! A second possible reason is that in a city now there is an incredible amount of cinemas , pubs , restaurants . There are several opportunities to enjoying . Furthermore each family has a car . A car allow to move people easier than before . Thus actual young people can enjoy themself more than previous young people . In fact the actual economy is better . There are more money , so there are several possibilities to enjoing .
(HIN,high) I agree with the statement . i would rather say the advancement of civilization is the result of people who took risks . when I say taking risks it would mean not only doing things or acts personaly which could be dangerous , example going to the deep seas in search of new lands but that would also mean going against established ideas , which were wrong . Had Galileo and the earlier astronomers not challenged the idea of earth being flat we would never have known the facts . For going against the established beleifs , Galileo and others had to face anger and punishments . Had it not been the efforts of Clombus we would have never seen America . He failed more than one time , was even improsined for failing to prove his theory , but in the end we owe him a lot . How is techonolgy advancing at such a great pace , we talk of Nano technology today . It is because there are scientist who always challenge the established frontiers . This requires taking lot of risks . Failure would mean wasting resources that are so costly . And also involve persona stigma , but than they dare it and succeed . The stories of scientist such as Thomas Alva Edision , Voltaaire are known to all . they were the people who tried out new things , even at the cost of people doubting them . Wright brothers tried something new and brought a huge change in the world of transport , Stevenson thought on a small issue and invented the steam engine . so the degree of risk might vary , but risks do result in some positive results . One thing I will like to add , the risks should not be blind , they should be calculated to some extent . this is applicable mostly for the purpose of trying out new business . Infact all the people I have mentioned above had done some or the other study to be sure that they were not doing something that was completely not required . Bill gates the richest man today , ventured into an unkown area and we see the result today . but it is not always that successful people have tried new things and they have succeeded . Many example are there which tell that if you leave something which is your `` core compitency '' you may fail . So the idea of `` core competency '' is very relevent . So try new things but keep in mind your core competency also .
(CHI,medium) There is no denying that the question of which people enjoy life more has become controversial . Not only for professionals , but also for public as a whole . Someone says that young people enjoy life more , while others dispute it . As for me , my personal opinion sides with the former . Among countless factors with influence my choose , there are three conspicuous listed as follow . First of all , it is easily observe in modern society there are a lot of entertainment . There are televsions , computers , radios , TV games and so on . There were many many different entertainment for the people to enjoy for their life . Besides this , they can also play different kind of sports . It is not strange to find out that no people will feel boring in the society . They have more things to do for enjoy them life than the older people as the various of inventions to suit with their life . Apart from this , people nowadays are more concerned about enjoyment than the older people . If the young people have a long hoildays , they may travel to visit different countries . If they have enough money , they may like to enjoy a big meal or shopping . All of these are different kind of ways for enjoying life . However , the old people also have their own ways to enjoy life . they would like to play chess with other . Or feeding pets such as birds , goldfish , dogs , etc . This is their ways for enjoying life . As for me , I would prefer to enjoy my life on the hi-technology things like televsion , computers . That is why I thing that young people enjoy life more than older people do . In conclusion , if we add up all the ways of enjoying life . We may easily to find out that young people have much more ways for enjoying the life than the older people do . Thus , I am totally agree with the statement .
(FRE,high) I 'm learning politics at the university and it is very hard to agree with this statement . It is also hard to response whether concepts or historical facts are the most important to know because I think that we hardly need to refer to common concept to gain some time between poeple who share the same knowledge but those concept are in general tightly linked to the context from were they are born . To explain something for instance a governement composition , action or organisation we 'll need to refer to common concept such as `` checks and balances '' , `` proportionnal majority '' , `` executif power '' , and so on .. You and your auditor must share the same definition of such terms to understand each other . But at the same time , in order to really catch the meaning of this words or concept , you need as an intellectual process to refer to something concrete . For instance , as you may talk about dictature you will often refer to Hitler . When you talk about communism , you will think about what happened during cold war between the United States and Russia . Ideas and concepts are not more nor less important than facts . The both are hardly linked in my experience Working only in an abstract way using combination of concepts to explain something would be , at first , very hard to understand because at the first concept you do n't understand you would be lost and furthermore you may not remember what you ' ve been listening for hours long . Secondly , I think that even in politics wich is called a science , poeple may share different definitions of a single concept for instance : democracy . Is a fascist party democratic ? no ? Not allowing that very party to take part of election is more democratic ? Concept and Ideas need the facts and context to be understood . And we can say that to really classify a fact or a context in an intelligible category we need concepts and ideas that we share . This explosion is called an insurection , this one an incident , this one a revolution and so on .
(SPA,medium) There are plenty of cases worldwide of people becoming successful without trying new things , but focusing and putting the whole efforts over specific and alligned tasks , instead of taking the risk of developing new things . Lets just consider a couple of examples to illustrate my statement , the first one is over a well known name on the computer history , Bill Gates . Mr. Gates has always been working on computers since the very beggining , developing a new system that allows computers to be `` friendly '' to the common user , produced and distributed by the Microsoft Company . In this sense , the products coming out from Microsoft has always been in the same line , avoiding the consumer to get into complex structures to undertand how interact with the computer . Another example comes out from a totally diferent field as is the one of finance . Mr. George Soros is a British man that has been involved in finance transaction for a very long time , and getting profits out of it without taking the risk of expanding the investments into different sectors , further that the capital markets . These two examples does not mean that a person taking the risk of doing new thing cannot become succesful , but shown a clear image that the path to success can be follow by just one line of risks , or if I may say so , by one line of ideas . Other example includes the music industry , where it is easy to find singers and groups with just one musical hit , that launched them up to the hall of fame . This is the case , for instance , of REM . This group goes directly into the music history records with only a few songs recorded some years ago , but still on top of the billboards worldwide and even considered as major clasics fot the real fans . The fact that this groups has never change the style , nor even the field of work , can be considered as another example of avoiding new risk and tasting the good flavor of success , in this particular case , for a very long time .
(TEL,medium) Enjoyment means make the life happy . by satisfying the soul of the body not only physically but also mentally . if a person can get through both the mental and physical stresses . Then the person is said to be enjoying his life . For the enjoyment of the life especially the is no age limit . both young ang old people can enjoy the life beautifully if they plan there life properly . if not the person at any age can not enjoy his life . In my opinon old people enjoy there life more happyily than the Younger ones because , in this morden world people should run with the time they rearly get the time to enjoy . For instance if u see a school going boy/girl they alway run with the time . there curriculam schedule is so tight that they are unable even to talk to there own parents . they are totally missing there sweet time by enjoying with there parent which is necessary for a young child to share his feelings , which is not possible for a young child . but the older people are spending enjoyable life by doing the things at the time they want to do atleast they are having that liberty . coming to the young people who are going to jobs they schedule is also not at all planned according to them . they hav to do hard work to earn money . The people around him will respect him only if he have money . So people all over the world is runnig all around to earn money . Such young people who are at great stress full job are unable even to take care of there health . so they are also not enjoying the life . If we see odler people who are out of there jobs are atleast having right food at time . they are enjoying by taking care of there own grand children . Thus , i conclude that even youngstrers can enjoy there life if they make some free time sharing there happiness and sadness with there family or friends . They can really enjoy the full sweetness of life than older ones . because they have great time to enjoy .
(ARA,medium) Nowadays there is an average of three cars to each family . With the ever evolving technology at hand today , the world has become much more connected , unlike the olden days , people now need cars for may reasons such as comuting to work or visiting relatives of freinds living far away . There , of cource , are pros and cons when it comes to disscussing cars . Cars have increased in nomber these days for many reasons . Firstly , they are a very comfortable way of travel , whith many having air conditioning , radio and some even have built in T.Vs . Cars are also very easy to use and can take the driver to any destination he or she desires . Currently with the increasing competition between companies , car prices have fluctuated . These effective vehicles can take you anywhere at any time , unlike trains , buses and other public transport systems which have difined scheduals and destinations . On the other hand cars have become a liability to some due to their constant need of maintenence and the large nomber of accidents which they cause , for example , you are 20 times more likely to die of a car accident than to die in a plane crash . The increasingly alarming rate of pollution cased by cars has pushed inventors to try and find alternative means of transport . The constantly increasing price of gas has led alot of people to abandon their cars in search of another , cheaper , means of transport . I belive that while there are many problems , such as pollution and high oil prices , that come with the use of cars , they are still the most efficeint means of travel and while many scientist hope to find alternatives to cars the chances of that happening in the next twenty years are extremely slim . I personally disagree with the statement , since looking back on previous years you can see that the nomber of cars being sold has only increased and at this rate the nomber of cars can only be predicted to contine to grow .
(KOR,medium) For me , as I am one of the young people according to nowadays , I belive that we do give enough time helping our community . I would like to introduce our works for our community . In school we are asked to do voluntiering work for an exact amount of time . According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do voluntiering work . Our school has to do more than 20 hours of voluntiering work for 3 years of junior-high school . This may feel that we are foreced to do it , but even though we are forced to do voluntiering , I say we eventually help out community . Young people nowadays do n't only spend time helping their commintity but also spend alot amount of time helping their country . Korea is a small country with no fossile fules or what so ever . The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students or young people intelligence . A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do . What I also knew was that Korea 's students had high grades in math and science than other country students . Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now . The result to this , many parents of Korea 's young people are making their children to work harder than any bodyelse . for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on . According to my thought , I think young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities . Although helping by voluntiering which is forced to do from school , I believe young people do realize they are helping out their community . For a small country without any natural resorce like Korea , young people are studying harder than any other student in the world to eventually help thier country .
(FRE,medium) It is common to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . For instance , it is obvious that young people party a lot more than older people , that 's why they seem to enjoy life a lot more . But , if we take a closer look , is it really true ? I 'd tend to disagree with this well broad idea , and as far as I am concerned , I 'd say first that older people ceize the day a lot more than young people do , and then I 'd like to underline the fact that the age does n't matter , that it is the person 's personality which lead him to enjoy life more or less . First , it seems obvious to me that older people enjoy life a lot more than younger people do , precisely because they have nothing to loose . They are conscious that they are going to die one day , therefore they are living in the present , they are enjoying every moment of their life . Young people , on the opposite , are always making plans , thinking about what they want for their future and how they are going to obtain it . They consider themselves as immortal , thus they are not really enjoying the present time . Older people experienced a lot of good and bad things and are now aware of what makes life worth living to them , consequently they are able to really enjoy their life . But above all , my opinion is that enjoying life is n't a matter of age . Some people , no matter if they 're young or old , will always live in the past , mourning about what happened to them , or spending time thinking about their good memories , and as a result , they will never enjoy life , the real life that 's going on before their eyes . That 's why I consider being able to enjoy life as a trait of personnality , which does n't depend on the age of the person but on its ability to be satisfied with what he has got .
(ITA,high) In the last 20 years the number of cars in use has increased a lot , thanks mainly to economic development and technology improvements . The car industry has , as consequence , improved a lot in terms of security and modern cars need less fuel than in the past . Given the bigger uncertainty and instability that are today present in the world , both from the political side and the economic one , is not obvious what will be the future developments . There are many reasons to believe that the number of cars will decrease , especially in Western Europe and USA . For example , I think that the traffic and the pollution levels that have been reached in many modern cities will not sustainable in the longer term since they effect negatively the overall quality of life in most richer countries . In addition , the current trend of the cost of petrol makes the use of private cars everyday more expensive . In this context , a well organised public transportation service would solve these issues by reducing the usage of private cars . On the other hand , it is likely that economies of countries such as India , China and Russia , will continue to grow at a sustained growth rate . This means that , expecially in India and China , where the population grows impressively fast , the number of cars will increase as well . The future of the car industry is another reason for which the number of car may not decrease in the next years . In fact , both in Europe and in the USA the car indutry is a very big and important contributor to the countries wealth , because it employs a large number of people . It is fair to believe that governement will help these industries to maintain their importance to avoid any social crises . In conclusion , I think it is very difficult to predict what the future will be . Too many uncertainties are present in our world today . I also think that a reduction of the number of cars , even if unlikely to happen soon , will strongly improve our quality of life .
(ITA,high) Is not easy in this case to completely agree or disagree with this statement . Reason being that ideas and concept cannot prescind from understanding of facts . A fact is something that is happened , while a concept is the reason why it happened . These two things have to go together for an individual to be able to catch the complete essence of things . For me , what this statement says , is that what happened in the past can easily be ignored , that facts , what truly happened before , play little or no importance in a student 's learning experience . Every History teacher will scream when hearing such an opinion . In many cases , facts can teach a lot more than concepts . Just think about our whole story , the story of mankind , and the big crime we would commit when ignoring what man did before us . You can study about culture and philosophy , about religion and mathematics , but you will never completely understand about yourself and the others until you 've learned about what has already happened and what has already been done . The concept of genocyde can be explained with hundreds of words , but will never be fully understood until what happened has been studied and observed through documents and videos . So the concept of , to give a contrasting example , driving a car can be explained with loads of words and ideas . But only when it comes to actually show what happens if you take a certain action you can fully understand about driving . At the other side , I must say that without a complete understanding of basic concepts , it is impossible to study proficiently any subject . Whatewer will be shown to you , always needed will be a clear concept that explains the meaning of what you see . A major difference between an Italian University and an American one is in the different learning method : while in the Italian institution fundamental is the necessity of remembering word by word what is explained in the books , without any practical application , in the American method this study is accompanied by an active class discussion and group participation . The first method will obviously bring every student to memorize the concepts studied , but sometimes without even understanding them , while with application and confrontation in the class , basic understanding of the concepts is needed to constructively participate and learn . Without concepts , there is no understanding of facts ; without facts there is no `` real '' understanding of concepts . The two things must go together .
(FRE,high) Since many years and among the history of the Humanity , the use of the car as always being important and in some cases indispensable . Nowadays , the situation is changing and we are face to a problem : do we still have to use our car while many factors influence us to use others solutions or to use less the car ? In my opinion , I would rather say that in twenty there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . First of all , it is important to remind the actual situation on earth . The cost of gas is extremely high and more than before . We can also say that it might continue to grow for many years . Why ? To serve interest of the governments and powerful people who lead nations or corporations . I think that people know that the gas ' price is too expensive and will continue to increase year after year . Moreover , it is relevant to say that the car ' cost is as much expensive as the gas'cost . In fact , today , if we want to buy a new car it costs a lot of money and in many cases , some families need to borrow money to get one . It is becoming a luxury product . It is useful to say that households are bored of this important growth . They would like to find other solutions in order to avoid taking their car . Then , one of the most important thing in our society today is the protection of the environment . How many households would stop using their car and find other way of transportation in order to `` save the earth '' ? A lot . I think so . The pollution due to the gas , the problems encountered with the forests all around the world become more and more familiar to the population . And I really think that people feel more and more concerned by that . By the way , it is important to notice that since a few months , we can assist to the development of a new form of transportation such as the commom transports ( bus , train ) and the come back of the bicycles in the big cities for example . In my opinion , the best example to prove that is the city of Berlin . In fact , I was impressed when I went over there for the first time , because we can see bicycles everywhere around us and people tend to use those new forms of transportation more and more . I really like this idea which spreads out in many cities today . Finally , we can say that the motivation of being a good citizen , the increase of the costs of the gas and the cars , will hopefully help people using less and less their car and prefer bicycles or common transports . I really believe that in twenty years , people will find others ways to go from a place to another . It depends on many factors but one of the most important is the motivation . I hope that people will take these piece of information into account in oder to change the future and learn how to use less the car .
(KOR,medium) Nowadays , we watch many advertisements in many field such as TV , radio , even during walking the road . By advertisement , we will give more opportunity for get job such as model , director , worker in broadcast and advertisement company . But there are also some problems . So I want to talk about this advertisements nagative side . Most advertisements uaually show and emhasize goods'advantages . Here is some probelm . They will use computer graphic , then it will be more look better than really is . Also this advertisement usually only expresses good 's advantages , not disadvantages . So sometimes , when customer buy goods after watching advertisement , customers will feel this goods cheat them . Then this customers will have bad feelings on that company . If the keep this happening , that company wo n't be get customer 's interesting anymore . As I mentioned , I disagree to advertise that only emphasize good side and make products looks much better than they really are . But actually , they have to advertise their products , so I want to they use both of advantages a
(HIN,high) I disagree with the concept of having a general knowledge of a broad variety of subjects compared to specialization in one field . In my opinion it is better to focus on one academic subject because it achieves more and the achievement is more thorough . In todays competitive world , I understand the importanceof having knowledge , regarding various subjects , but i think , such knowledge should be pursued at lower levels of education , such as college or high school , to develop the overall personality of the student . However , in higher education specialization is a must , since , it provides greater opportunities for the future and experience during the period of training . For example , If you look around , those doctors who do not pursue a specialty course ( general practioners ) tend to do well in their practice , but those who do specialize , run a spectacular practice . This is relevant to both the nature of cases treated and the salary earned . The specialist sees rare cases , reffered to him by the general practioner , increasing his knowledge in his chosen field . He is better able to treat the condition and naturally earns more , as well . Another example - on comparing the jobs allotted to postgraduates with those allotted to the graduates , one can see the preference is given to the former . A Law student is more likely to be recruited with a prestigious firm than the average High school pass-out . Experience plays an important role here , because there is channelisation of forces acting to achieve the higher goal . Also , if one wants a broad knowledge of subjects , the number of goals naturally increases . This requires time , effort and money . Consequently , efficiency is greatly reduced and complete knowledge of each subject can be easily compromised . In my experience as a student i realised i did well in the years when i had thre subjects to cover in undergraduate school as compared to when I had four subjects . In all fairness , subjects in each year required intensive reading . Similarly , i have noticed that the class valedictorian , usually , excels in one or two subjects and not each subject , clearly showing how difficult it is to master each . `` The Jack of all trades , the master of none . '' I would not llike to be associated with that phrase because i think it undermines the motivation to succeed . Success , for me is the attainment of a goal , which requires focus . If there are numerous paths to follow then success cannot be gained beacuse of loss of focus . I believe in a firm foundation of knowledge of many topics upon which i can build my expertise ,, just like a plane wih a braod middle and a pointed tip , which is in conformity with the principles of aerodynamics .
(ITA,medium) I do agree with the statements . We need to start from ideas to draw our own personal conclusions . I believe our mothers are our best examples , they tought us not facts but ideals , values , good purposes to that in our life we can use what we learned and apply them into actions and facts . And we understood them as CONCEPT at firsta nd we applied them in our life seeing each day results . The importance of facts in the process of learning it if of course crucial . A fact that happens , especially if unexpected , can be a ` short cut ' to understan what thet idea or what the concept it is and how it is hidden behind it . In general , i think the two parts are very much linked almost two halfs , infact i think that the first is very often the conceguence of the second . Thus we cannot split them nor we should invert them . To understand the power of a concept we need to see the facts that this idea produces as well as seeing a fact will make sense completely only when we can deduce the concept that sustained it ; by doing it i believe that what we learn will be stored in us as a complete information cause-effect and we will be able to recall it when a similar need will emerge in our lives . That is the reason of why we study , eventualy to prepare us to the real world and to give us the capacity to overcoming problems and help us solving situations . We can learn the trueness of this sentence considering as well how could i understand if a concept or an idea that by definition it is thoretical will answer me the same way
(ITA,medium) I think that there is not a general answer to the statement , because it depends on the courses and on facts and concepts object of them . Surely , it is very important for students to learn ideas and concepts , but it does not mean that everytime they are more important than facts . There are some courses , for example History , in which the facts are the main important part of the program : therefore , if We , according to the statement , will not give the correct importance to the facts , History will be more bored and less important . For example , it is important to know ideas spreaded in the America in the eighteen century befor the war of indipendence , but I think that it is more important to know facts which caused the war of indipendence . However , in other courses , especially in science and maths , the ideas and concepts are considered the most important things to learn and to teach ; since , although it would be interesting to know the life and the different way to discover things tried by Isaac Newton , the core informations about him are the ideas and the discoverings . Moreover , i think that ideas , concept and facts are arguments which increase the culture of a person , and indipendent on the school purposes , it is nice to know something which is suitable . Unfortunally , students prefer to study only to achieve good grades , without give importance on the real meaning of the argument , for such reason it could happen that will be more important what will be for available for thei aim . In conclusion , I think that it is important to understand when it is more important a fact and when it is more important an idea or concept , so I disagreed with the statement , since I think that it is not right to apply such concept to all courses .
(TUR,medium) Majority of people are really effected from advertisements ; as a result of that companies use this way to support the consumption of their products . I agree with the statement that products seem better in most advertisments . Not tested products are selling on markets / Firstly ; the most important thing is to effect women who spend most of their time by shopping . Especially make up products are on market with just small changes . By changing its cover or smell its sold like a new product . Also hygenic products must be tested . Sometimes in advertisements it says ; our new product is for sensitive and allergetic person nonethless when you use it you see that it is not real . Secondly children want to buy whatever they see ; Bright covers or little toys which are given with the product effects them . On the other hand with the improvement of technology new products are on market each day . For example last month I bought a new mobile phone which I saw an advertisement on TV . It is said hat it does not effected from water and I dropped it in the rainy weather and as a result I can not use it anymore . After market services must be effected In conclusion ; I agree with the statement that sometimes advertisements are not showing the truth . They mostly the new producing way of a product with small changes .
(SPA,medium) Nowadays , the quantity of cars is increasing very fast , but cars need petroleum and this resource is decreasing fast too . For these reasons , we should ask ourselves if it will be possible to continue using cars in the future . In my opinion , in twenty years there will be more cars than today , but the important difference will be that those cars will be more ecologic or they will use another resources than petroleum . Firstly , it is not sostinable to keep the actual consume of petroleum for many years , so there will be a moment when we will have to find another energy sources for cars . At the same time , new technologies are improving theirselves everyday , so in few years it will be possible to find a good alternative for petroleum and to invent new machines much more ecologic . This means that the fact that petroleum will finish does not mean that cars will finish . Futhermore , everyday cars are more necessary for people . That is because , in modern societies , people need to move much more than before . For example , many times some families have their home far away from their jobs or the education centers , so they need to drive a car to go to the workplace , to bring the kids to the school or to go shopping . Finally , we have to know that many undeveloped countries , where now there are not many cars , are developing their economies and in the next years they will demand more cars for their population . For these reasons , I think that in future , the quantity of cars will continue increasing , although , with the new technologies , cars will be ecologic .
(HIN,high) I am in complete agreement with the given statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . Ideas and concepts are very important and they act the source of general conscience in human being . I feel so because understanding ideas and concepts is far more important than just learning facts only . If a student is clear about the concept and idea behind a phenomenon than it will hardly take a second to learn the fact . It is concepts and ideas that give rise to facts or one can say that fact is denouement of ideas and concepts . To clearly undersatnd take an example of `` falling of a hurling ball on the ground '' . This falling of a ball on ground is a fact but the force of gravity and the phenomenon of gravitation comes under ideas and concepts behind this fact . So just learning that a hurling ball falls on ground is trivial as compared to the concept of gravitation . Also learning facts does not count to intelligentia , one shuld have logical thinking and innovative ideas to get success in any field . Logical thinking is the path to success . And logical thinking develops only when one think innovative ideas or mere ideas , So one should think newer and newer ideas to solve a problem . Thinking innovative ideas leads to logical thinking and reasoning . As everybody is familier with the milieu of competition , so to survive and compete in this competitive environment the students shoould be ancouraged The students should be encouraged to go for understanding of ideas and concepts instead of learning of facts only . If the students are good then the institute will also succeed and definitely the country too . So to make future generations better and competitive the students should be encouraged to understand ideas and concepts rather than mere facts only .
(CHI,medium) Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . However , others disagree . In my opinion , I think the former statemment is true . This is because young people are energetic , brave , and chanllengable . Young people always have energy to do many things . For example , they will use their free time to hang out with their friends . They will go to some places to enjoy themsleves as clubs , bars , and movie centers . Furthermore , young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than stay at home . They are afraid of grounding because it is indispensible for them to have fun . In addition to being engergetic , people who are young have bold to enjoy their life . For instance , they try to do things which older people afraid to do . Like ferry wheels . One can conceive a 80-year-old man sitting on the ferry wheels will almost kill him , but not a young person . They are always being curious about new things . Moreover , they will not bother how much money have they left . Instead , they will have a great time to spend the money to find their dream beautiful life . Finally , young people can endure the chanllenges . A example is , they will chanllenge new stuff to know the right way to enjoy life even including doing drugs . On the other hand , older people prefer a peaceful life . It is clear that I agree with the statement because young people have energetic spirits both pysically and mentally . Therefore , they will not feel tired by having fun in their lives . Also , they are never afriad to pursuid their happiness in their lives . Lastly , they are the people who can be chanllenged to enjoy life . For the previous reasons , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
(FRE,medium) Today , more and more often old people is showed by the society as slow and sad people . But this point of view is really restrictive and cannot be share with everybody . First , to my mind , the definition of `` enjoying life '' can change with your age : not because you cannot enjoy like before but just because your mind change . For example , when you are a child , `` enjoying your life '' is just to play with your games . When you begin to be a teenager `` enjoy life '' is to begin go in clubs , in bars . When you are thirty years old , you need to enjoy life spending time with your friends or succeeding in your job . I think when you are young , it is really hard to understand enjoying life of older people because you did not discover what they lived and what they need . Then i think anybody need to enjoy his own life with his own dream or his own hobbies . More when you become older , your body can accept everything it accept when you were young . Something which was really sweet and so easy to do when you were young can become quickly hard and so strong . Then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can become with your age really easy , funny or sweet . For example , to do go in clubs or do extrem sports can become really hard when you are older , and to learn chess can become really enjoying when you are older . To conclude , I do n't think every body can have the same one , because this term is linked to the target you gave to your life . This target can change and is too much personnal to be shared with everybody . And this is really hard for the different generation to understand why older or younger enjoying life with a another another activity which is not your view of `` enjoying life '' .
(GER,high) A broad knowledge of many academic subjects is surely useful and to a certain point also necessary . However , I do not think it is better than a specialization to a certain field . I think a mixture of both points is the best way . In other words , a trade-off between broad and specialized knowledge is necessary nowadays . The basis of a broad knowledge is already made in school . All the children become the same eduction and have to pass the same test . By doing so , the students are prepared for different future scenarios in life and they also become an overall picture about the world . For example , the students at school do not only learn maths and language , but also biology , chemistry , histroy etc .. Thus they get a good understanding about the relations in their environment . Consequently , a broad knowledge is very important and also necessary . On the other hand , the information input increases with the age . Hence , after a certain stage in life a human being is not able to gain all available information . Additionally , each job requires specialized knowledge . Consequently , a person has to choose which information is more important and useful for his future life . For example , after school a student has to decided what he want to do with his life and he has to answer several questions . What kind of job I want to do ? What are my main interest ? To sum up , I think that it is import to have both , broad and specialized knowledge . The broad one to get a overall picture of the world and to understand its important relations . The specialized knowledge is necessary and not less important .
(TEL,medium) I would certainly agree with the statement that states `` successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because people are successful only if they could do something which other people does not think or try of doing them . Successful people are those who dare to try new challanges and takes risk to to achieve desired results . One example of this can be explained from my college days , my college has a three day festival called `` euphoria '' on the third day an actor agreed to come and perform in our college event for some amount of money . But on day before his performance he called the management and said he want more money to perform as our rival college was willing to pay him large sum of money so our college management told us that they could not afford that much money to bring that actor to perform . As we have printed the invitation cards and even distributed them , so we took the risk of using our college lemonaide machine which was not in good shape , we took great pain by staying in campus at night and repaired that machine and from next day itself we started to sell lemonaide to people visiting our college to see the function as it was in the summer season the total lemonaide was sold and we got required money to make the actor perform in our college . By making the actor to perform in our college without financial help of our college management every one in our campus started to respect us and labeled us as successful candidates who saved our college reputation . Thus , successful people are those who not only try new things and takes risks but makes there every move in order to help and improve the place or conditions people live in .
(GER,high) Althoug there are still many young people who are very engaged in their commmunities , I agree that in general they do n't provide enough help . Especially by observing the intense need for help in many communities because of less support from the government it is clear to me that there should be much more young people engaging themselves in their communities . Nevertheless , I have the strong impression that the interest in social activities has decreased among young people . This has three basic reasons . First , I am convinced that the decrease of importance of religion in the modern society has caused a more egoistic approach in life of young people . Since there is less religious education , providing moral values , the emphasis is put on personal succes but not on helping others . Thus , it appears that helping the community for many young people is a minor goal in live than egoistic aims . Therefore there are less young people who are helping their community by taking part in social work of the churches . Furthermore , young people are also less interrested in politics . Threfore the young people spend their time with other things like personal amusement and do not try to realise their political and social views in their communities . For example in the generation of my parents there were regular political debates in their town , where also young people made proposals for social projects and also participated in such actions to realise their political aims . Lastly , I believe that live in big cities prevents young people of helping there communities . Although there is a lot of social work to do especially in big cities , only a few young people are trying to improve the situation because they probably feel anonymous in big cities and cannot identify with socially weaker people . Apart from that there is also a lack of group feeling in big cities . Consequently the young people do not experience life as living in a community and are therefore less motivated to offer their help .
(CHI,high) From my point of view , I agree with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject only . I will explain it from three aspects , personal interest , personal development and vanishing subject . Firstly , not much students can realize their interest that which subject they like most . Many of them , including me would get frustrated when we should make a choice among thousands of subjects to study in university . However , if we no need to choose a specific one to concentrate on , we can expose to different kinds of subjects and hence develop our interest . It is really regrettable if we make a wrong decision is choosing it . Secondly , broad education can nurture students to be an all-rounder . All companies demand all-rounders instead of students with specific knowledge . Of course , everyone should have his/her strengths and weaknesses . However , broad education allows students to develop more comprehensively . For example , the art students may be weak in communication skills or the science students may be too rational . But if all students are put together and study more subjects , a student 's personality may have influence on the others besides gaining other subjects ' knowledge . Last but not least , it prevents some subjects to be vanished or even disappeared . Sometimes , students choose subjects that have good future career such as business . Few people would choose subjects just based on interest . Therefore , this leaves some subjects like Chinese history to become vanished . But Chinese history actually is worth studying and important for young people to familar . At this point , if we set broad knowledge is a must , the problem wo n't happen . In conclusion , studying in many subjects is better than specialize in one as it allows students to develop more interest , to become all-rounded that can benefit their future career and also prevent some subjects from vanishing .
(FRE,medium) ( It is a well-known fact that people who take care the most of the communities are authorities . But we should ask ourselves , do we have to be working in the government to help in the communities ? Should young people give more time to help in their communities ? ) To begin with , young people sometimes partcipate in helping their communities . They organise games or some fun activities to raise some funds for maybe bying some sports equipments in their school . We can add that young people do give clothes or unused objects to charity . They might even help during their short holidays for taking care of the elderies . Or sometimes help giving papers add in the road , to inform tha population about something . However , young people give only very little time to help their communities . Firstly young people are also busy , . Their most occupying activities ins going to school , or to college . So that might make them forget of the possibility or giving a hand to the weel-being of their community . So , for an example , they can use the little time they have for themselves to relax an enjoy life . Secondly , young people are not very responsible . they do not really care about what is happening in their communities . sometimes they do not even care whwt hwppens to thw
(TEL,medium) I did n't agree with the statement that `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. '' why means it was a known fact that `` Knowing every tthing about something is better than Knowing something about everything. '' and also it causes poor knowledge in the fild an individual has to be choosen for sustainment . It will be clearly dicussed in the following lines . Firstly , What a person needs is that the term `` Profficiency '' . Because it would be the thing that the modern world needs . Every field needs the people to be profficient in that field and a little or no knowledge in other fields . Even the most famous scientists whose inventions may stick to thir feild . So every individual needs himself to be expertise in any particular choosen field . Moreover the former would gives him a lot of confusion towards the respective fields . Secondly , the process of broadening causes a lot of unemployment apart from developing inadequacy in the theories pertaining to his own field . On the other hand it gives a sort of uselessness to him in his career objectives . Ofcourse it gives the broad knowledge to the individual , it creates a lot of disaster to his family members and also to the country . Nextly , knowledge of many academic subjects may cause loss of individuality . Moreover the development of any field depends upon the effective utilisation of the sources and their research in those fields . What it means is that the person needs to show his attitude and concentration for the development of the selected subject . Because in the era of rapid growing technology the individual may get his identity only in his specialized field . Finally , for the overall development and for the well-being of the individual , one needs specialization in his respective field . This gives him ability to promote his identity even in the most unfavorable situations .
(GER,high) The statement `` Successful people try new things and take riks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' in my opinion clearly illustrates the main reason why people become successful after all . I think that it is obvious that successful people are people that stick out of society and out of the establishment , not only because of their success but also because of new inventions or techniques used by them . Certainly , successful people are people who do not do things the way everyone does them , just in order to be different from everyone else . A successful manager for example has to find new ways to improve his business , his finances and to motivate his coworkers to really change something . The concept of change is crucial in this discussion , because as I am convinced success always has to do with change . Many times this change is not positive at the beginning because it hurts to change something that has proved it 's usefulness and value for a person , a business or a company . Change can be slow at the beginning and sometimes may be proved wrong , but in the majority of the cases , change is the key to success . Therefore , I think it goes without say why successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing things they are good at . Another point that supports the statement derives from the psycological area . People who are successful are happy and selfcontent , at least in most cases . If someone feels good about the things he or she does , and in addition to that feels good about him - or herself , it is easier to try out something new and challenging . Self-esteam helps you to realise the things you want to do and the things you are dreaming of , even though they may seem new and risky . A person who is always aware of his failures and negative traits is not even willing to try something new thanks to the fear of failing again . Successful people on the other hand are not that likely to be put down if something does not work out as they planned it to be . One last point I 'd like to mention in order to conclude this essay is the human hunger for power . Once you have achieved something , even such a non-material thing as success , you do n't want it to be lost . You probably would do nearly everything , including taking small risks and trying out new things , to maintain the standard .
(CHI,medium) Have you ever tried new things and take risks ? Have you ever had a false sense of feelings when you do this ? Or , you just want to concentrate on things that you know ? If I were you , I would prefer to try something new and encounter any kinds of risks . These kinds of behaviour are indispensible , and they are the role to suceed . Trying new things would probably expand your horizons . You would have an opportunity to explore the universe - discover different cultures , polish your laguange abilities , improve your communication techniques or leadership qualities - all are invaluable experiences . Only if you had the faith to try new things , you would enjoy the fruit . Take Nadal as an example . He is undoubtedly one of the best tennis players nowadays . Have you ever heard of his story ? He played soccer instead of playing tennis when he was in his fancy age . In spite of the fact that he had never played tennis before , his bravery encouraged him to taste tennis . Shortly after that , his envious talent in tennis was discovered . His success nowadays , was originated from his bravery to try new things . Why do n't we try new things ? Apart from doing something new , learning to take risks is also critical to a success . Risk management plays a major role in any kinds of business , sports , politics . Once you have made a decision , risks are inevitable . Imagine that you were a participants of a gambling campaign , once you have gambled your money , risks occur . You may loss your money . But once you learned the skills to take and manage risk , you would take the loss as a piece of salt . Taking risk may develope your strength as well . All in all , trying out new things and taking risks are the major factors to succeed . Albeit that doing what we already know may be saft and secure , others qualities are also important .
(ARA,high) When one goes on to pursue a higher level of eductaion , one normaly has the choice to major in a specific subject or have a broader and more general approach to several subjects . Normally , one 's first year of university is where he or she makes that discision and sticks with it for four years . Which f the two would i prefer ? In this essay i will demonstrate why choosing a specific subject to specialize in would be the better way to go . Today , jobs are becoming harder and harder to find . After universtiy , I either have to choice to cary one with a higher level of study and master the subject i majored in or to move on into the working world . Every person 's goal in life is to achieve wealth and happiness , but how would one reach that goal if he or she is n't qualified enough . Companies are looking for fresh garduates who have studied in a specific field and know what they are doing . They must also have a minimum of experience that goes along with the extensive studying . Once he or she have passed their learning process they can move on to use their ares of expertease in the working world where they will acquire good jobs and be well paid and maybe some day be the top of their field . Studying with a broad knowledge and not specificly have an area of expertease may have one advantage and that is where he or she had a more enteresting learning experience and a wider general knowledge . But this waya of learning is n't complete one ca n't find good work if he or she is n't well trained in a specific field . And I think that haveing a job is more important than having a wide general knowledge . In conclusion one must focus in a single are of study to achive high goals in life and reach welath and happiness as it is the most important thing to support a family and live a fullfilled life .
(FRE,high) What do people usually use to guide them when they are traveling ? I remember two years ago , my friends and I went to New Orleans , Louisiana for a trip . Before we left , we went online to find all the attractions in the area . However , we got lost so many times because we did not know the area ; nor did we have a tour guide . Therefore , I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because having a tour guide will decrease the chance of getting lost , and it will be less likely to get involved in an accident . First of all , having a tour guide when traving will decrease the chance of getting lost . A lot of people , when they go to a certain area for the very first time , inspite of having a map , have the tendency to get lost . One reason for that is because sometimes the maps that they got online are not updated . Hence , they get lost on the roads , which can cause them to be angry . I remember while my friends and I were on our way to a mall , despite the fact that we followed all the directions in the map , we still got lost . But , we had a tour guide , perhaps , we would not have lost . Besides having less chance of getting lost when traveling with a tour guide , the possibility of getting an accident is also low . In Florida , it is said that lots of people die when they go visit a place due to car accidents . The reason why is by looking at the map while they are driving . But if they had a tour guide who knows the area very well , they would be less likey to crash . Thus , a tour guide would be very helpul when traveling . In conclusion , I am strongly in favor of the idea of having a guide when traveling . For , this will minimize the chance of getting lost and getting an accident .
(KOR,medium) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and I am strongly agreeing on that statement . Currently the world is changing in extremly fast speed than what we expect . Especially technology is the part where humans are really concentrating on and that will bring lot of influence to the future car . Also environmental problem will give influence to stop making car . According to the news article , the world gasoline will run out in next 10 years . If there are n't any gasoline left in the world then the car wo n't move . Currently most of the cars are moving with gasoline and it is in serious problem . Lot of car companies are feeling this is serious problem , and they decided to make hybrid car . Instead of making new designed-car they thought making hybrid car will be more efficient car in the future . Instead of gasoline , they will use alternative energy such as crude palm oil or the sunlight . Next twenty years will come really fast and probably they ca n't produce lot of hybrid cars so numbers of cars in next twenty years will be fewer than now . Second lot of environmental issues had been brought by cars and that will reduce the number of cars in the future . At present , due to air pollution , the global warming is happening . The ozone layer has the huge hole due to air pollution . The main reason can be CO2 which is coming out from the car . To save the world , lot of country will reduce the number of cars to stop global warming . Anyway as I mentioned in above information , the car wo n't go because there wo n't be any gasolines left so cars which is running with gas will goto junk yards or developed into other tool machines . With two above evidences , in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Due to cars which are running with gasolines are causing lot of problem to the world and that will reduce the number of cars in the future .
(TEL,low) knowledge is nothing but the detailed information . knowledge of the accadamic subjects and the knowledge of specialised subject or interest of area . i preffer the broad knowledge on the accadamic subjects . intoducing a new subject are very usefull to us . in the subject of acadamic have a basics and some deatiles about the subject . because of this deatils are very usefull to the human life and future also . for example take mathematic subject , in this we have calculations and divisions , etc. mathematics subject come up to the undergraduation . mathematics are very use full in calculations of heights of the mountains we are using the integration , it is one of the mathematic topic . although mathes are using in physial department also . every subject have relation to each other subject . knowledge is dewine . knowing of the new subject is very interesting as well as slightly difficult , because the subject new to the student they can fell little more difficult compare to the other subject . ouer mind have a grat stability so we can have knowledge of all acadamic subject means thats not going to be difficult . although knowledge in the specific subject is not going to help to the future , now a days the new technologies are coming to the world . we should have a knowlede of the acadamic subjects . in acadamic they are introducing new tecnologies and topics which are going to be use full to the student thats go ing to change rapidlly . take aexample as a computer . in old day computer is not there . now a days computers r must and should to the student . the knowkedge should be the newly arravied and old also . so the knowledge on specific subject is not best . how ever the knowledge of the acadamic subjects r going to be vwery helpfull . by learning a specific topic thebroad knowledge of the acadamic subjects is good
(GER,medium) I do not agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts. '' , because this statement generalizes that ideas and concepts are always more important than facts . As a student there are always classes that contain for huge parts of facts , for example history . Other subjects , for example psychologie , concentrate on ideas that have to be prooven later on . In deed it is important to always have a general idea what somebody is explaining and to understand how a concept works , but using a concept practically without having the knowledge of the important facts around and behind the idea is mostly not possible . For example : it is good to understand the concept of a war , but that includes not from when till when it actually happend , what the factic conseqences were . A concept is always just fifty percent of reality , the other fifty percent are the facts that set it into context . On the otherhand would it be almost useless to collect all the facts about for example the second world war , if you have no idea about the causes ; the ideas and concepts each party of this war had . With only one , fact or concept it is neither possible to completly understand something nor to make the step from the idea to reality . Therefore my opinion is , that understanding a concept is for students as important as the facts surrounding the concept . Both must be understood to realize a topic .
(TEL,medium) I agree with the statement , because in my view , it is only understanding ideas and concepts for an efficient learning in addition with practicality of the facts . In childhood we had learnt everything practically . A student in school or collge should select to his/her interesting subjects , and he/she can even research to invent new things . Idea an concept behind a thing may seems to routine of any other also , but there would be minor differences which have to be explored by a student and even teachers should help students to do that . Early mankind , before 15th centuary , was not aware of the practical strategies that are going around him , physically and chemicaly . In two to three centuries before now people started exploring the world around them to make a better lively-hood for them and their family . In the same way a student would grasp ideas and concepts with interest of learning facts which seem to be amazing for the student . Teachers should give much support to the students who seem to be more enthusiastic in learning and would make the country to be proud of the student . Student should make practical imagination to explore more ideas to enjoy the subject . such intererts ev
(JPN,high) I will support the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do . It is very short time that people are called as young . So I think most of young people enjoy their life because the time is really limited . My opinion is composed by the following reasons . First , Young people have enough time to study or learn at school . Most of them are going to the school in order to obtain the skills or knowledge . Sometimes studing is hard for students , but they can enjoy the class or lesson with their friends . Futuermore , most of schools have some interesting events for the students during the year . For example , my school have the event called `` Internatioal Day '' in which students in the international school will sell their traditional food or perform the traditional dance to other students . It is very interesting for me and I really enjoy it as I take a part of it . Second young people have many opportunity to find out what they want to be in the future . It is difficult to think it but young people have enough time to consider what they want to do in the future . They can go to the university or expertise colledge in order to study more about the fields that they are very interested in . Sometimes it is possible that they can experience the social work in the society . For example many young people are willing to have a part time job . Some people can find out what they want to do in the future through their job . Finally young people can hang out with their friends during their free time . It is important to make a good friendship with others . Most of older people do not have enough time to spend their time with their friends because they are busy . In contrast yound people can meet and talk to the friends whenever they want and can spend their time together . The friendship will be good as well . Sometimes they can travel to the foreign countries and make a great memories there . To conclude , young people have enough time to do something good for them . They have much time to study a lot , to spend with their friends and to think about their future . For these reasons I agree with the idea that Young people wnjoy life more than older people .
(FRE,medium) The place of car in our daily life is a really controversial topic . But , I think that some elements allow us to think that in twenties years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . First and foremost , pollution has become a real issue and governements all around the world begin to be aware of the danger of the use of cars for our planet . They hence try to implement some policies in order to reduce it or remplace it . The Kyoto agreement encourages for instance to improve common transportation like the tube or buses . Moreover , to my mind , it 's only the first step and in the next years , these policies will be more numerous and more efficient . In addition , our societies acknowledge that the use of the car triggers a lack of physical exercise and some problems like obesity . Walking now is becoming a popular way to move . Furthemore , technologies and communications allow us now to do a lot of thing without leaving our home . For instance , you can go and do our shopping on the Internet . And it 's just a beginning . A lot of new possibilities will appear in the next few years . Some people nowadays still work at home . They hence do n't have to use their car to go to work and it 's actually the main purpose of the car in our societies . These new kind of workers will develop as well and so cars wo n't be used in the same number and in the same way as today . By way of conclusion , i would like to say that i really back up this idea that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today thanks to the awareness of their pollution and the progress of technologies .
(CHI,high) Advertisements will do anything to grab your attention . Whether it be a commercial on television , a page in the magazine , or a billboard . Make up , food , clothing , or any other product that seems appealing to people these days , are always advertised much better than they truly are . It 's always exciting for women to see the gorgeous eyelashes in the magazines from a certain mascara . It looks long and thick in the magazines , but once you buy it , it looks nothing like what you saw . Being angry and throwing the mascara away wo n't help . That 's just the way advertisements are . They are made to attract people and made for people to buy what they are trying to advertise . Or else , what 's the point ? Why would an advertisement be about something to make people sick to the stomach ? ( Unless it was about not doing drugs and showing a picture of what it could do to you . ) I remember when I was in second grade and I was walking through a store and I came upon this barbie convertible . The box had a picture with Barbie and Ken in it , and I thought wow how great ! A convertible with Ken AND Barbie in it for only 20 dollars ? ! However , when I got home and opened it , I realized that it was only the convertible . Little did I know , the advertisement on the box had in tiny words `` Barbie and Ken not included . '' Even if it has the words in tiny letters on the side , the advertisement is still tricking you and having your mind not even think twice about reading the box or paying attention and just buying it . If the picture on the box only had a convertible , it would look dull and unappealing to most , and therefore they would n't earn any money . The commercial industry always has to make a product look better than it really is . Even when it comes to pens , they have to make it look like the coolest pen in the world . The smallest products in the world are advertised to look better than they really are , and it 's all for business , and money .
(ARA,low) I agree with that , as student I have to have concepts and an apinion . Because it is diffecult to have a good knowlugde without clear idea and searching about the benefical point for example when you able to study at some unversitay in the U.S.A than you must have that you can suppurt you apinions first , I would like to explain my experince when I was in my countury studying in the unversiaty since than I was interrnsted to learn English as scond language besaid my own leanguage ; however , I coudnt learn it in there because I didnt have the idea to increase my skills such as speaking who I could speak English amang Arabaic speakers that is I think impossble , at the same time with the rest of skills , scond , as long as you have concepts I think you will be a succssful person ; therefore , you will be able to invastgate the facts . Inconclusion , as student I do'nt deny that I should be carrying concepts and supporting them as much as I can ; on the other hand , I ca n't imagen that who say on himself student dose'nt have a great ideas brhaps that is g
(KOR,medium) Some people might say that try new things and take risks to suceed . But i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreay know how to do well . Because those who are working like professional , they have confidece and dream when they work . First of all , they are not always successful either they try new things or not . I think the most important thing is confidence for success and without knowledges , it is hard to try new things and take risks . For example , one of my friend studied economic but now he wants to transfer to art school . Does not it make sense ? he had not been drewing about 20 years , so that he gave up . Like i said , when we try something new things , even we should have basic technic or knowledge . In addition , we have to have dreams for our successful life . There are so many people who try to new things without dream . In my opinion , If we just work without dream , we need more time to suceed than peolple who have dream . For instance , In korea , people try to suceed everyday . But it is extremely hard to suceed , even they have skills . Thus many koreans surrender their job then they have their own business and they are more successful in life than people who go to company everyday . In conclusion , we all want to suceed . But in order to suceed , we have to have confidence and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do very well . If we always try new things without know-how , we always might be behind .
(FRE,high) I think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary , it is the first step of a good education , a good foundation giving the best chances to adapt . But then it is often required to get a specialization . In our society being specialized in one specific subject is more and more a necessity , vital to get a job or to hold a position in a company . Also it helps to have a better salary . It will often depend on the type of work or position . For example , lawyers should have broad knowledge of the legal system , the main legal principles and cases . But during their training , they are required to choose a specialization . Corporate lawyers should have a good practice and experience in Company Law . They cannot practice in Public Law and be good at it at the same time . These subjects are too different . The more they can get an experience in a specific area of Law , the best they will be in their area , the more they will be competent , recognised and well-paid . The issue is the same for people working in Research or in the medical sector . After a certain number of years of study , a specialization is often mandatory for a certain number of jobs . But the above mentioned statement can be exact for managers for example who should have a good knowledge of many areas of their companies in order to be able to take the right and appropriate decisions
(TUR,high) With the advancement of the technology in the communication sector , the companies are now able to market their products to an anormous number of people in a really beautiful way . For example , the advirtesements on TV are so attractive that people watch them as if they were watching movies . Unfortunately , they are misleading most of the time , as they make the products seem much better than they really are . I think , an example from real life would make it clearer what I mean ... A few years ago , we were considering to change our family car . Therefore , we were researching different models of cars , what their properties are , how much they cost , and so on . First , we tried to follow the TV advertisements to get an idea . According to these advertisements , these cars were so good that it was hard to believe that they were actually not from future . Nevertheless , they did not give us much information about the futures of the cars . So , we decided to go to the agencies , where cars would be sold , to talk to the salespeople there and to get catalogs with detailed information on every single aspect . Of course , the salesmen were really sure in their statements that the cars they sell were the best and capable of doing everything . Therefore , they were not very informative . And neither were the catologs ... The problem with the catalogs was that they were written in such a way that an average person would not understand what they mean and how their cars were different from other models . After all these attempts , we were even more confused than we had been at the beginning . So our choice was nothing but a random one . At the end , we had a car that would break quite often and create problems all the time , although it seemed to be the best car ever produced . Now we know that , the advertisements are not the most reliable tools to refer when deciding on what to buy . I guess , it is much better and informative to talk to people who have already bought these products to figure out if they are good or not .
(ARA,medium) Young people really do enjoy life more than other people because of alot of reasons and in this essay i will talk about them and try to explain more about it and i will talk about people 's opinion and my opinion mostly . In my experiance about people and what they have told me is that older people do enjoy life more than young people do and that is because they understand the world more perfectly than when they were young and it is mostly true but there is other reason is that they enjoy the marritial life and developments when they are old , that is people 's opinion . Personaly , my opinion is that young people enjoy life more than older people do because i like to think of it like the child has no fears and no ambitions yet and he got nothing to worry about exept playing and enjoying life , thats what i like about young people mostly . Their is another reason why young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people dont worry about aging and they always think that they can do the impossible and they dont have the least bit of worryness on them or they dont feel anything about it and it is so good . basicaly all life is enjoyable and fun but it is not all about life , their is family and more other things that need to come but enjoying life is them most important thing to do . I agree to this statement and i recammend to pass it though other people to understand the meaning of this statement and to think about it very well . That is all i could say for this statement and i think i have said alot of thing in it so enjoy life and enjoy reading it .
(TEL,high) I agree with the statement young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Young people of this modern world do not care about the communities around them and being a human being it is our prime responsibility to help the communities . As man is a social animal he tries to live in a society and mingle with the rules in a society . The young people nowadays have changed a lot due to the freedom given to them and independence to do any thing they wish to do , the young people are least bothered about their communities . instead of helping the communities when they are free they go out and have parties with friends . The young people are given the financial freedom by their parents to such an extent that they even never bother about their parents as well as communities either . Moreover all the youngsters are not alike , some people are busy in their studies and jobs and they do not have much time even in spending with their family and also with their communities either . so they will be unable to give enough time for their communities . The young people nowadays do not try to take any responsibilities which they think are not necessary . The young people more often think that it is not necessary for them to help their communities and go out and enjoy with their friends when ever they have some free time . Nowadays the young people are interested more in refreshments they are required from their daily routine work and get relieved from their responsibilities instead of helping their communities . In contrast some of the young people inspite of their busy schedule find some time to help the communities and they fell that helping their communities brings a change in their routine work . This is the case of few people who still fell their moral responsibility of helping , where as most of the young people nowadays fell no responsibility about their communities . some of the young people are only concerned with their job and their family and nothing else . So young people must soma have find time to help their communities .
(TUR,medium) Nowadays cars are the most common transportaion vechiles for human race . The reasons for this fact are firstly cars are individualstic so you can use whenever you want . Secondly it can be faster than public transportation . Finally and absolutely cars are much more comfortable than any other vechiles . But what are going to happen to cars in future ? I think in future the cars will be use less often than today . There are too many reasons for this opinion . For example in my country the number of cars are increasing but the roads ca n't be enough for this much cars and the drivers are exhausted about traffic jam so they start to think about getting rid of their cars and using public transport . Furthermore I think the biggest problem is gasoline prizes . They are getting higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy any . These are the socio-economic disadvantages of using cars . Also there are different possibilities to make cars less important and less usable . Technology is growing so fast and scientsit can make faster trains , faster planes and the stations and airports are becoming more comfortable places and the tickets for more comfortable transportation are n't as high as they were before . By this way using plane is n't a luxury anymore . Furthemore technology might make a flying cars like in science-fiction movies . i think this is n't a waiting for too much because 40 years ago automatically openning doors were utopia in books or movies but they are real and common now . So maybe someday we will travel by flying on ourselves not in planes . In conclusion by the developing of technology and the socio-economis difficulties of having cars makes us to find alternative ways to transport . Even now cars are very popular that does n't mean that it will go on like that . New discoveries will make cars unpopular but this will take long time .
(CHI,medium) I argee with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their communities . With the development of technologies , more and more funny products are coming into exsitence and entering peoples ' daily life . So it is not surprising to find that young people would spend hours on PC games alone , instead of taking care of or talking to some old people in hospital . Take computer as an example . A survey shows that global computer selling is contuniously growing , and so with the demand . And some teenagers do claim that computer is their best friend . With computers , they are able to chat with oversea friends , watching latest hot movies , or surfing on the internet . Since the time in a day is 24 hours , which is eaqul to every one , they of course do not have more time left to help their communities . By contrast , teenagers in the old days did not have such kind of entertainment . Therefore , it was common for them to visit and help others ' families in their community . Moreover , freedom resolution started in California of United States in the 1960s showed a wrong example to young people . Instead of having a steady belief in God in mind , more and more people choose to believe nothing , which has already proved by a report on European citizens . It is indeed correct that the nature of human beings is to help each other , but having some belief will enhance your feeling to giving a hand . So lacking belief has surely a negative impact of those young people nowadays . To sum up , I argue that too many kinds of entertainments and lack of belief lead to the fact the young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities . But I not saying that they are more selfish than before , rendering that there are just more aspects of life to pay attention to . In order to make some changes to this situation , I would advise parents to spend more time on their children and show them some positive examples .
(HIN,high) I strongly disagree with this statement as the need for personal transportation will be even more in next twenty years than what it today is . Rise in the living standards of the people and faster life style would be the possible reasons behind this prediction . people are becoming more and more independent and solitary in their life style so the need for personal cars is going to be more . There are certain things wich may resist increase of the number of cars in future and one of those is the fuel problem . The major fuel for cars these days is petrol or other chemicals derived from petroleum . The amount of fuel we have under oceans etc is expected to last for another 100 years . so there will be enough fuel for the cars in next twenty years . but even then other types of fuels such as C.N.G and hydrogen etc are also used by car manufacturers now a days so it would not let the extinction of cars happen . cars are definetely going to increase in number on roads in next twenty years becase they have been made safer now a days than they were before . with all this technical advancement and safety experimentation carried out at a war front level new models of cars coming out of the factories in future are going to be very very safe for the drivers . last but not the least , with all the above reasons , the reason which might be the biggest and the most powerful reason behind increase in car 's population on the roads will be affordability , the mass production and competition in the market is working towards cutting down the prices of the cars so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be able to buy a car of his choie . The freedom of mobility , safety and affordability would increase the number of cars on the roads in next twenty years .
(ARA,medium) It 's up to people and what they want to study in their current life , they choose to study more than one subject and some just focus on their one and only subject . I am a undergraduate student , I had my long time choices up , I have one last semester , and I have chosen that I want to study electrical engineering , but , I have considerd that I dont only want to study electrical engineering , I also want to study language , there are these two types of languages that I really want to learn , which are Japanese , and Italian , it 's cause when I see people talking other languages I say to my self that they are brilliant and clever people , it 's not as easy as you think it is studying more than one subject , it makes you look more expieranced and much clever when you mention that you talk more than one or two languages . My basic point in the last paragraph , is that I want people to think and consider the same thing I am thinking about , I am sure if they do think the same way I am thinking , people would study more than two subject 's . Right , people ask themselves that we are only good at one subject , for example which is business , so we cant study engineering cause its so hard and complicated , what I say is that this is the point of the reason why people should go for more then one subject , it doesnt only teach you about engineering it also teaches about expierance for example , now you have a house to build for your family and you dont have any clue what to do , you cant let a person rip you off by selling you equipments that you never heard of , so if you had that knowledge , you could get the things you want and how you want it . I am not basiclly talking about engineering this goes out to all the other subject 's . The main reason I am talking about is that , it is important to study more than one subject , because it gives more knowledge and expierance in life .
(ARA,low) My opinein is the take wrong way to answear this stuotine qustion . However they try to sersh about the importint point to understand this proplem . Anyway I think if they understand the stuotion very well then you can take the way is halp you to fix any proplem in any part in the life . For exampol when they take trees to learn about it the they take something are have connecting with this problem and I think this is corect way to be know about this stuotion . In another hand they went to take wood to help them to push what opinein the trees give they to anderstand .
(FRE,high) To be honest , I disagree with the given statement , which suggets that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for many reasons . In my opinion , if you travel accompanied by a guide and a group , you will not be totally free of any movement . I mean , usually , this kind of organized travel plans the trip from the beginning to the end and you have no other choice than to follow it . When I am travelling , I prefer to remain able to decide where I want to go and what I want to see . The guided tour will obviously take me to the most touristic points in the country I am visiting , but usually , those places are not the most interesting , judging by the differents trips I had the chance to do . It is not rare while visiting a city or a country to find surprising places , mainly ignored by the tourists but many time more attractive and pleasant than the well-known sights . When I decide to leave my daily routine to enjoy the pleasures of a trip abroad , it is always to go somewhere I can be alone . I live in Geneva , Switzerland , in Downtown , so I am used to live surrounded by a lot of people . So for me , travelling means going as far away as I can go from that , and doing it with a group does not exactly help to find this tranquility . I do not talk about leaving with a friend or a few people , even though I have never travelled with more than one person , but it is still a huge difference compared to travelling with a bunch of people you mostly do not know . Another point which makes me disagree with the statement is that I absolutely hate the guided tours . Do not get me wrong , it is not that I do not like the cultural aspect which can lead me to learn a lot of interesting things , but I find utterly boring to listen to someone who repeated his speech so many times he does not take any pleasure to do it anymore . I prefer get the cultural information from a travel book or from a local citizen , who often love to proudly talk about the history of his country . You cannot even stop some once they started , but at least they do it led by their heart . To sum up , I could say I do not have any interest by going in vacation with a group and a guide .
(ARA,medium) Does successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? Successful people try new things . To be successful is to be the best and different . If we are different that 's mean that we are always looking for new things , new ideas . The world is always changing like as . I think that the reason that make people successful is that they are always changing and having new things . If this people are taking risks ? Of corse they do ! But who cares ! Taking risks make as feeling in life . Life become more exciting . Successful people are not scarred to loose but they ca n't support doing always the same think . Of corse they have to do well what they do but they are always lurning , and changing . I really do not think that we can be successful with doing only what we know how to do well . For me , I will called that '' stagnation '' and may be we can become successful for one periode but when the tendance will change if we are not able to try new things and change with the tendance we will not be able to keep our succes . For exemple , for the scientist they need to do experience , try new things take risks to make some invention , or discover new medication . Of corse they know how to do it well what they already know but to be on the top of the screen they have to find newest and greatest things . So in Conclusion , we can tell that only doing what we already know how to do well is not part of the successful people . For sure that will be a reason of the succes but not to keep it . To keep the succes , we have to try new things and take risks .
(KOR,medium) It is controvercial whether having knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subect . I prefer to the latter opinion because of two reasons . The first is self-esteem and the second is specializing . Second , having broad knowledge seems to be benifitial for entire life . If you try to be a waking dictionary , however , you need to spend all times to get slight knowledge . On the other hand , if you focus on a specific subject , you will be a specialist in your field . In modern society , most company requires a specific degree in your field . When I tried to entire a report teacher , the company required a highest level 's license . Therefore , a specific knowlege needs to survive in this hardcore world . First , self-esteem is the most important postuer in my life . The specific goals give us a suitable motivation . Without a goal , the motivation does not exist also . When I was a high school student , I was a sports player and I wanted to be a national athlete . Then I got a serious injury at a game . Because of the injury , I had to stop playing game and change my dream . My parents wanted me to study and become a teacher . I accepted the proposal from them . However , it has been my dream entire my life to be a national athletes . I could not continue to be a thecher . I returned to a player . Some people can said me
(FRE,high) Community ? Who still helps his/her community ? surelly young people do it less and less . It surely is disappointing but there are obviously many reasons that explain this behaviour . Firstly , it is hard for young people to find time to help their community . Since school asks a lot of work and that more and more young people have sport after college , it is difficult for them to find a place in their schedule to help their community . In fact , society is so much turned towards self-accomplishment that it is hard for people brought up with this ideal to turn towards someting else . Secondly , the point of view of the friends matters a lot , and since it does n't sound very `` sexy '' to do community work , a lot of people just never do it . Imagine the laughters of friends when you say are helping an old lady while they are going to play basketball ! the young people helping their community may feel rejected and thus stop helping their community . I 'm not saying that paying attention to other people remarks is what I 'm doing or what I prone , not at all ! I 'm just saying that it is a behaviour I have observed . Thirdly , unless youg people work in a political field where they really have the power to make things move well people do n't really find it interesting to help their community . Nowdays young people are so much turned towards the futur that ( often ) their only idea is to leave their city , to build their own life far away of the one their communities have . To conclude , young people do n't really help their community and it is a behaviour that is surelly pittyful . But can we really accuse these young people ? maybe it is also the fault of the society which build us up in a way that we don ' t really feel the need of helping our community . A society yet more independant , more liberal and thus less familiar and social .
(HIN,high) I disagree with the fact that in twenty years time there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Infact i believe that their numbers would have gone up ten times . Cars have become the most basic and primary modes of transport in the world today . From the time they were introduced until now , their numbers have gone up exponentially and there has been no decline in their sales . Providing both riding comfort and safety , cars have become the basic necessity for all and for some it has evolved to become a fashion statement and an article of pride . People now a days , are in the false belief that the use of cars might stop in future because the petroleum reserves are slowly getting exhausted . But what they fail to realise that petroleum is no longer the only source of power that can drive the vehicle . After years of research new technoligies have been devloped realising this danger Hybrid cars are already being produced and marketed . So are electrically driven cars . However some researchers are working on using hydrogen as a fuel . Sucess in this will be the biggest break through ever in the field of automobile engineering . Hydrogen is available is abundance and it also has a very high calorific value . Thus capable of producing greater power than petrol driven vehicles . In addition to this the problem of pollution is also solved as , the only exhaust that would come out of a hydrogen driven vehicle would be water . Twenty years is a lot of time and by then this technology would have not only been tested but would be driving the entire world . Seeing the latest innovations in this field , cars with better looks and aerodynamics are being manufactured . In twenty years time concept cars , which have already taken a start , would be in full production . Our world is full of people who admire beauty , safety , comfort and most of all technology . Thus making cars not a curse of the past but refined gift for the future .
(ITA,medium) Nowadays advertise occupies a central position in our life . Some person belive strongly in it , instead any other are sure that it can produces negative effectives in the quality of our life . In my opinion advertisments make products seem much better than they are in the reality , and so in the following paragraphs I try to explain my point of view . When we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easy see adverstiments ; they talk about food , for instance , or clothes , cars , bank services etc .. In all these situations the objects , or the products , appear beautiful , confortable and in same case chip , nethereless when we decide to buy one of them we have a surprise . For example , the last year I saw a beautiful photography machine in a television advertise , it seemed very small , easy to use and with a lot of different functions . In this way , I convinced my boyfriend to buy this model becuase I thought it was an incredible occasion , infact the price is not so high in relation wiht the quality . The day after he decided to buy this photography machine , and unfortunately my boyfriend and I , using it , understand that it use not so good . The same situation happens when we buy a food only for the fact that it is presented in a particular way in the advertise ; for example , the advertise uses a specif enviromental , color or situation to expain the caracteristics of the food , and as a consequence we immidiately decide to buy it . To sum up the adertisemntent make products seem more different and much better or more cheap than they are in the reality , and so we note the differerence unfotunately only when we decide to buy it , I think it is not right !
(FRE,medium) Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree with this statement . I will argue my viewpoint by giving example and explained the importance of the community . It true that not all the young now dont give enough time for their communities but other youngs have a particular devotion for their communities . For my view , the a large number of youngs are individuals . Nowadays peoples in general and youngs particularly focus on individual success . for example life go fast and has become very difficult that youngs have to work hard . There are only face to new individual challenge in order to satisfy their need and there familly . For example me , I know that I could help my communities with my academic experience , but it more important for me to find a job , to work hard to keep my job , to be married , to have a children and to take care of them . It only after that , that I will think about how to help my community . Therefore It very important to think about the community . The question is how to help my community ? By giving my viewpoint on some importante subject , contribute for school bulding , by undertaking research project in order to develop my community etc . So I would like to advise young to pay attention for the community , even if there not interested to participate for the development there are to take care by not destroying what the community has built . I would also like old people to understand the young because now life if more difficult than before to focus on many thinks at the same time .
(TEL,high) I partially agree to the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . This is very much true and applicable to the present day situation as knowledge of only one subject is going to reduce the number of options a person has in his career . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help a person view a particular situation or issue in different angles and can be more careful in taking a decision after taking into consideration all the ins and outs of that situation or issue . For example , if we consider a marketing executive trying to sell a washing machine , he should have knowledge though not in detail on the different small electrical systems that make up the total machine , also he needs to have knowledge on different kinds of textile fabrics and how the washing machine should be used in case of each fabric . He can be successful only if he convinces the customer and to convince he needs to have broad based knowledge on all the those discussed . People with broad based knowledge can easily shift careers according to what the industry demands and have a great flexibility to work in any area of specialization . On the contrary , the world would not have developed so much if there were no people with specialization in one subject . Only if one understands each and every concepts , can he implement them and bring out a new product . There would not have been new discoveries if there are no specialists in this world . Referring to the washing machine example , only a specialist and not generalist can build such a machine and can improve the features of it . Specialists are very important when it comes to the technology development and advancement . Concluding this , having specialization is also important but what i feel is there should be a good mixture of complementing each other .
(HIN,medium) Well its a popular phenominon `` to exagurate rather than to tell the truth '' . This phenominon is bieng used by every advertising agency In todays world there is noting which is not bieng advertised . Now it is a trend that every big company would hire a celibrity or a person fammiliar to the crowd to do advertisments . These advertisment companies would try to make their product the best among their compities . if we take the example of a very big company called cocacola . sum dayz back it was confirmed that the use of pesticides in India for the cococola bottels in incresed to an extent . So what they did was they hired a cilibrity and conveyed the messege that the bottel is not at all harmful and is safe . These companies advertise in such a way that they make us bileave that there products are the best in buisness . these have negative as well as positive impacts on thje phycology of people . the positive impact is that they happily use their products but there are too many negative impact . First of all the companies are not telling the true reallity as where they stand and if the products are harmful , they only concentrate on the profits . The second problem is that due to intense compitition they do not use quality products to lower the prices , so the consumers have heath problems . Advertisments play a very important role in the minds of consumers . They are more confident in buying the product they have already heard about or atleast have seen its ads on the T.V The role of advertisments is increasing day by day and the faking of companies on their products would increase too through advertisments , and thus the suffering would be taken by the consumers .
(GER,high) In my daily business I am working as a consultant for a German consultancy company . Actually I need to find solutions for an Asset Management company , which needs advise how to go on with their back office system . When I first met the COO he told me and my collegues to calculate a business case for his idea to centralize the back office business . This is my first job and so I have never done something like this before in university , but I learned some facts about the aspects a business case has to contain in my finance classes . So it was possible for me to take that challange . What I want to mention with this short story is , that you need both things in your daily life . On the one hand you need to understand the ideas and concepts the professors shows you , on the other hand it is also very important to learn facts , a kind of vobaburaly , to understand and deal with these ideas and concepts . At the university you first have to learn facts . It ist neccessary , not only in the field of business administration , also in natural sciences or other subjects . Without facts students would have no basis to discuss about . Everybody would understand a topic in another way and a comparison would be impossible . Facts build the basis on which you can set up walls , in this case , ideas an concepts . At the end you can build up the roof of the house . That means , the student can use all the facts and ideas he learned in a hole on a new topic . In your daily life you need the problem-solving competency to deal with different tasks you get . This competency you can only reach when you understand different types of concepts . So it is important to understand ideas . In conslusion , I think it is the neccessaty to understand of both , facts and ideas to be
(ARA,medium) i disagree with this statement . At the biggening if a person have a broad knowledge of many academic than he will know many things but the problem is that he can not do or work in a spesific topic . that person will have only vague idias about many topic , and that mean that he can not do a spesifique thing . In the other hand if a person is more specialized in one specific subject it will be better for him . that person who is specialized in one topic will know all the sides of his subject , and will be a profesinal on that subject so he can work on that specific subject and be good . her is an exampel of to brother the first know his working in a very big company and the seconde one is still looking . how he become like that ? The answear is that the first one was working hard on his specific subject and gotte his degree after a normal time of work and the seconde one was not sure of what he wanted and and keept changing topic each year . will that lead him to no work , rach time he try to get a job he is not very informed on the topic . i dont say that it bad to know many subject , no it good to have a general idia on many subject , but in order to secssed in life you will need to to be specialized in one specific subject . this is my personal view there are people who will agree with me and other who want and i respect their point of view . people are very worried about there futter so it better to be specialized in one specific suject , and after if you have time learn more . in conclusion i say that to be specialized in one topic is better than to have broad knowledfe of many academic subjects .
(TEL,medium) Enjoyment comes in ones life that may be young or old when certain result has a positive result / impact on one 's own life . As , there may be more positive results in ones life he / she may feel more enjoyable compared to others . Whatever , be the case i prefer young people enjoy more than adults always . For this there may be many reasons few of them include their feeling at success that may be in studies or in sports , with their family , with their friends . Firstly the success , every one enjoys their success . At studies when one does the best research paper the encouragement from teachers from then make the student feel happy . As an example , when i did a research paper on NANOTECHNOLOGY the encouagement given by my professor was more enjoyable considering my interests . considering at sports student encoraged by his coach on his previous win on his cricket match serves the same purpose . Secondly , young people enjoy being with their family as if his parents are his best friends and the moiral support they give him in every aspect of his life is more cherishable and enjoyable in ones life . Thirdly young people enjoy being with their peers than any other aspect of their life . They enjoy by going to tours , field trips , parties , playing games watching movies and so on . Making good friends-helpful at needy - makes them feel more enjoyable In conclusion , the young age itself is the time to enjoy ones life . So , eventually every one does it . Even , when one asks the older people which abe life experience they may certainly feel that it-their young age - was the bes
(TEL,medium) It is an increasingly busy life that we all , are leading today . Presently the day 's are such that we do n't even have time to talk to our neighbour , or as a matter of fact we are too busy to spend time for ourselves . Under these circumstances it is hard to expect anybody to work for the welfare of the community or for other people . I completely agree with the statement that `` YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES '' Today 's youngster 's are leading a very busy schedule . In order to cope up with the pressuers of life , the person has to be multitasking . while , studying in the university , today 's students are requires to work and at the same time , concenterate on studies to get best of the grades . Even , for those people , who only work , the company that they are working in leaves them no time to spend for themselves . It 's a global world , which is characterized by a lot of competion and only those who are willing to put their best efforts in work can survive here . Although , young people are not able to do much , because of their schedules , a device has to be worked out to carry out the welfare activities .
(TUR,high) As a student majoring in bussiness management , i definitely know how important advertisement is in selling a product . However , this does not mean that advertisement increases the purchase in a right way . For example , it is not allways possible to find a product in the way that you saw in the advertisements , many times we find it worse than we thought . Thus is because the manufacturers tend to show products ' properties better than they actually are . First of all , it is common that most firms deceive people about the function of the product . They try to show that their products serve extreme performance . A very good example of this is slimming products , such as diet products . I want to express something that happened to me recently . In the television i saw the advertisement of a new product called `` diet patch '' . It was stated in the advertising that after a person uses diet patch she would not feel hungry . Consequently , she would lose 5 kilos in two weeks . As soon as i saw this advertisement , i bought this product and started using it immediately . After two weeks , while dreaming of loosing five kilos , i could lose only one an half kilos although i did all the things that were said in the instructions including the diet . Secondly , in order to make customers buy their products , most of the firms demonstrate the appearence of the product extremely better than they actually are . The most common example of this is the advertisements that are related to summer holidays such as tour organizations or hotels . Last year we wanted to go to a hotel for our summer holiday . Thus , we searched the newspapers and among various hotels we decided to go to a hotel which has 2 swimming pools . The picture in the newspaper was so lovely that we could not think of any other hotel . But , after we went to the hotel it was a muddy pool . Finally , in order to pursue the customers the firms make advertisements that show their products better in ways such as changing its fuctions and its appearance .
(JPN,high) I disagree with the statement . Traveling in a group takes away your freedom in time and space You may find it is easier and safer to move around in a group , but in reality , if you wish to go and stay in a certain place for a certain time , that choice is not possible if the group has a different agenda . A tour guide can be useful and informative , but this also takes your agency of deciding what to see , where to go . The best part of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the safety and the less effort you need to gather information about the place , and information for ensuring the safety . But this is also the worst part of traveling in a group , in that , it eliminates positive accidents . By positive accidents , I mean your opprotunity to meet people , find a great shop or street by accident , find a new things about the place which may not be marketed in the mainstream tourism . Traveling in a group can take away some occurences that can only happen because you have no agenda or specific information , because you wonder around . A good example of this is going to a restaurant . If you travel to Hong Kong , you find there are restaurants that are specifically for tourists . They are expensive , give less ifnormation about local food and culture , and you meet no locals . But if you are willing to take a risk of wondering around , asking around the local people to show a good restaurant , that experience can give you so many episodes . You get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the `` local '' way of doing things . Since I prefer adventure and really experiencing a place when I travel , instead of being a part of marketted and `` selling out '' tourism , I choose to travel alone , in my way , in my own timing . If I work hard to find a good restaurant , I would like to decide what to eat there and how long to stay , not minding what the group may and should do . Some may say the trouble it takes to gather information about the place on his/her own is too much , and it is better to leave the job to the tour guide . However , recently there are so many books and websites about traveling alone ( or as a couple but without any guide ) that are easily accessble , that the things I mentionied above about getting around on your won can be easily found in a book , such as `` Lonely Planet . '' After all , traveling is a means to get away and placing yourself in an odd situation , getting away from your mundane life and chores . In that perspective , no group tour is beneficial if that limits your adventure - possitive accidents . By planning and traveling alone , you may find a new aspect of the place you are visiting , which is your own original version and not the marketted version that are equally given to any tourists . I think my position can be easily supported by the numerous current TV programs about backpaking , traveling alone , seeking so-called adventure in traveling . A famous example of this will be a program called `` global trekkers . '' Now the trend is in adventure . Traveling in a group with a tour guide may be a good idea for older people , but for myself , I chose traveling alone .
(JPN,medium) Some people think that yonug people can act more than older people , and yong people can spent more enjoyable time than older people . For the following reasons , however , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . First , older people have more free time . For example , older people can retire his job when the people got enough money to spent their least life . Many older people can spent both money and time for what they want to do . Some older people can travel all over the world . Some people can gather antique jewelies all over the world . Some people spend his life treating their gearden . By contrast , young people have to go school . Yong people do not have enough time and money to do all what they want . Second , older people have a great deal of knowledge and experience to spent time . For example , older people can enjoy even in five minutes , if they know writting poem . When the older people does not know about writing poem , they would hit on other ideas , ssuch as reading books , talking with others , and thinking about their offsprings ' future . They know various choices , because they have experienced various past time in their own past . But , young people does n't . This is adventage for older people . So , I strongly disagree that older people enjoy their life less than young people .
(HIN,medium) I would agree that the best way to travel would be to travel in a group led by a tour guide . It is very necessary to have a good tour guide who takes the group to all the places in the city , which we are visiting . There are various advantages of taking a good tour guide . Firstly , if group is accompanied by a good tour guide then we will be able to see all places of the city which we visit and it would be awesome to visit each and every place of that region beacuse one does not plan trip to the same place again and again . So it would be a good idea to see all the places in on trip . If i went alone i might not be able to see all the places due to lack of knowledge of that area . Secondly , a tour guide will provide me lot of knowledge regarding the art and architecture as well history related to monuments and palaces . Without a tour guide it would be really difficult to find all this information about any place . Sometimes we might have difficulty in following local language of people but if we have a tour guide he / she can easliy undertstand the local language and we can enjoy the local flavour of the place we visit . In today 's fast paced world people dont have much time . In this case a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in very less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place himself/herself . To summarize , It will definitely be a very good idea to take a tour guide , who can tell about the place in much more detail and show the place in less time as compared to self exploration of the place .
(JPN,high) Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ? I strongly agree with the statement for three reasons . Understanding ideas and concepts is important for development of students ' ability to apply , to care for others , and also to come up with questions and theories . First of all , without ideas and concepts , students cannot use the knowledge in daily life . For example , let 's say there is a boy who has learned the pythagorian theorem but has never been taught how the mathematicians came to the theorem . He does not know where and how the facts came from , therefore is unable to apply his knowledge for some similar but different problems . Secondly , I believe that the sense of moral issues can only be developed through vast knowledge of ideas and concepts . To understand how people act , students have to know ideas and concepts about human mind rather than facts , because everyone is different . If students are taught moral issues as facts , not as concepts , they will likely to stick with that idea and not able to think of other people . The last and probably the most important reason is that understanding ideas and concepts well may lead the students to develop with further questions and theories . Knowing where and how a fact comes from gives the students better understanding about the fact . Moreover , further investigation using concepts will lead some of them to find facts that have never been discovered . Development of theories is definitely due to well-understanding of ideas and concepts . Some adults , even the teachers , insist the students learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts . I strongly oppose to that opinion . As I stated , understanding ideas and concepts result in students ' ability to apply knowledge , to understand moral issues , and to come up with questions and theories .
(GER,medium) The environment is suffering from all the air pollution , that leads to a warmer earth climate . This has already the effect that poles are starting to melt . That is why the protection of the environment is becoming more and more important and everyone is getting aware of the dangers and risks we are provoking . Everyone means mainly people in first world countries because the developing countries usually cope with other severe problems first . The worlds population is increasing exponentially . Developing countries strive to achive a life standard equivalent to the first world countries . Some , such as India for instance , are getting closer to this objective . They work very hard to participate in the world trade and in forming a strong economy . They attempt also to raise their life standard and this includes the purchase of cars . In first world countries a car is a sign of wealth and independence . As long as there are no further inventions to replace cars this will not change in such a short time as 30 years . Maybe the gas will change to renewable resources but in the end a car means more comfort and independence and that is what nowbody wants to give up . That is why I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
(KOR,medium) Many people who are from my father 's generation tend to not to believe advertisements on the television or news paper because , at that time , the power of consumers for their right were really bad , and there was no department for consumers . In addition , the technology fo our mass media was not excellent , so they could not distingush the qualities between the real one and advertising one . First of all , approximately 40 years ago , there was no department for consumers . Therefore , consumers bought some products after seeing some advertisements that could make people buy their products even if they did not need those . However , even if consumers realized that the products were not same as the advertisements , all they could do was just went to the companies making the advertising and required exchanging to new one or refunding money . However , nowadays , the power of consumer is so huge and powerful , it can shut down a company . For example , if the products are different from companies ' adverting , and consumers can notice that , companies will appologizea bout that . There are many ways to know a company 's adverting whether it is true or not . Especially , for consumer by using the internet is so useful to write about a company 's averting and
(TUR,medium) I agree the statement that '' its important for students to understand ideas and concepts it is formed than it is for them to learn facts '' ... At the university ? used to be a stajyer teacher and ? had time to observe students easily . When students starting to learn a new subject the most important thing that the teacher have to learn how much information that the students have about that subject . Bas ? cally the way or techniques of teaching to a student starts with testing . ? ts the important way for the way which you are going to teach with . To learn what they know , to grab their attention with chiming them in , to show them most of them in the class do n't know so many things about that subjects , to get their ideas from the name of the subject although they dont know anything on it etc .. When the introduction part finished the other step for teaching is to try the main idea for the subject . This is the most important part . Because its the first part that the student start to learn something about that subject and pay the most attention to the teacher with the happ ? ness to learn new things . Probably this is the most effective part on the students also if they interested the subject they would love to learn other part of it , if not the attention will fall down . The facts about the subject is less interesting or on the other hand most useful but easily forgetable part . For example think about you when you were at primary school you started to learn how to write and read . Are you remember any facts of them or ? can ask you like this ; are they any facts of reading or writing ? I think no ! As a result we can say that understanding ideas and concepts of a subject is more important than it is facts . When you a student learn the main idea he/she can use his/her mind easily and get the subject correctly with a help of a teacher or a person .
(GER,medium) In my oppinion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject depends on the skills you already posses and the stadium of your study . My suggestion is to visit a lot of different and widespread spectrum of classes in the first and second year of your studies . This will definitly help you to build up a solid fundament of overall knowledge and basic skills . Perhaps , when beginning your studies you are not quite sure in which area or specific subject you want to specialize in the future . Therefore it is helpful to get an insight into many subjects in order to find out about your strengths and interests . After this period of orientation , I clearly recommend you to specialize on a certain subject . Until now you should have already gained a fundamental basic knowledge and a clear view of what your interests look like . So now it is time to enhance your skills in your field of interest . It is very important to gather detailed knowledge about your specific subject , because that is what will make the difference between you and someone with general knowledge . This is your advantage . For instance , if you later want to apply for a job in industry or at a research facility , it is necessary to be provided with good specific knowledge and skills . Otherwise your employer may think that you might not have unique strenghts or interests and chose someone else . Today it is very important to be an expert in your field of study in order to compete with others . By specializing on a certain issue you show that you are able to concentrate on one topic and that you are able to go into detail . Provided with these attributes you will stand out of the masses and you are thus well prepared for future challenges .
(CHI,medium) I agree what the statement just said , successful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Waht is the correct meaning of successful is that you need to try your best , and you also need to learn new thing to improve youself . If you want to prove yourself into success , the way you do it 's that to learn more thing and whaen someone is asking you , you need to able to answer them . When you solve someone 's problem , i think that guys will think you are good because you know the things they do n't know . The successful person 's personality must be very confident , problem solver and be intellgent . This kind of person will like to learn more things , and they will try to find out the problem they ca n't even figur it out . They have to be not very pround of it , because if someone is trying to ask you question and you starting to have the feeling like you are the powerful , wise people . I promise abou that next second you will be in the deep cave , and nobody will think you are a successful person . Actually , been a successful person is not easy as you are learning somthing . Learning is very basic to be success , but the way and the attitude you face is very hard to understand properly . Such as you are a very wise and you know lots of things , but you always think you are the only successful person in the world and you don ' like someone asking you question . How do you know that everyone know you is a successful person , they will just think that you do n't know the question so you are not able to tell them . `` To be or not to be is a question '' , this greeting is very famous and important to the person who is success . Just to learn as much as you can learn , then you will be the successful people .
(ARA,medium) Everyone is looking forward to be successful person . In order to be successful you should have a lot of a good chacteristics . You sould be a competitive , an avid , intelegent , strong , wise and challenger person , also you should have the ability to learn any thing new even if you dont like it . Moreover , you have to be a brave person , so you will not afraid from having risks . Some successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . In my opinion , i agree with the person who tries new things because of several things . First of all , of course when you try something new you will increase your exprience and your knowledge . For example , one day my administratore asked me to prepare a presentation with power point program because he beleved that i know how to work well with that program , but i made a decision to take a risk by useing a new stronger and difficult program . Finaly , I have done that presentation perfectily and successfully . One more example , when i face any hardware or software problem with my computer , i will not ask any person to help me. instead of that I will try to solve that problem myself . According to that , i will have a lot of experience in the computer field . At the last , as far as i am concidered , the life require from the people to learn new things , to have risks , to increase their experience and their knowledge . Otherwise we will not be able to survive in this life .
(SPA,medium) In twenty years a lot of things can happen , we can use cars more or fewer than nowadays . But if a have to choose I will say that in twenty years we will use less cars than today . I would support this answer by saying that in some years we will see some consequences of our irresponsable actions towards the enviroment so this could be usefull as a warning that will help people to be more consciense and careful with their actions . For example today we are confronting some of this consequences . Such as pollution of the air , water , soil , etc , . We are getting many disease , cancer , intoxication also we are finishing with a lot of species and every species has a porpuse or a roll in the circle of life so we are desorganizing it . A good example is the problem with deforestation that we have , trees are leathel because they gives as oxigen and many different things and with out them the circle of oxigen will miss a basic component . In addition in twenty years technology will be more advanced so it would be more responsable . There will be more facilities for public transport . Public transport is a good solution because we save time by moving a lot of people at the same time , we save money an gas that both are really important and also is less pollution because are fewer cars . Lets put Mexico City as an example , it has 22 million people as population and most of the have cars and a lot have more than one per family , imagine the traffic that they generate this will be follow by a huge waste of time and gas , so in conlusion by using public transport we will save all this problems .
(JPN,medium) I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing to do . Because of two reasons . First of all , succssful people usually think about new things and keep trying to be successful . They may do not like to do same things to the other . I think that they have a parsonality . However , if they want to do new things , they have to spend a lot of time and money . In addition , they do not know that will be succeed or not . I think they may contribute a society or they want to get a good job . At second , they try new things for some porpsose . For example , if they want to be more rich , they try to find more better job . Because If they have personarity , they may invent something instead of money . In my opinion , I usually try new things eventhough I had to take risks . For example , I came in U.S to study nursing in a university . When I came to U.S before , my parents did not permit me to go the university . In parents opinion that I do not need to go to and university and get a job in U.S , because I already have a nursing license inJapan . Finary . I pasuade to my parents , and came here . However , If I go to an university , I have to spend a lot of time and money . But I believe that it is the best choice for me to study inU.S . So , If I have many risk now , If Ican contribute a society , I think that is valuable for me . In conclution , I think that people require knowledge and skill . They will not succeed without it and also they will have a risks . But if they satisfied about that , I think they should do that before think toomuch . Because it will good opportunit . Therefore , I think that people should try to new things .
(GER,high) I agree that people who take more risks in life and try out new things are more successful than others . A good example for such a person is Bill Gates . He was one of the first people in the world to do research on computers and who developed the internet . Introducing a new technology to the market is risky because of all the work , time , money and effort he put into it . Nowadays every country in the world uses the Internet to communicate . This shows that Gates has had alot of success and that he is now the richest man on earth . Therefore the risks at the beginning of his career have paid out very well . Of course there are several people in the business world with a comparable history . Another example of people taking risks are those who invest their money into stocks . The stock market ist proposedly the most risky way of investing your money . On the other hand , poeple who are successful at the stock market are at least ten times as succsessful as people that only do what they know best . With good stocks , you can make over 1000 percent the money you have invested in one day or even hours , while other people only get the same salary month after month . Even people who already own a big amount of money do not simply let it be . Especially these people let their money work for them in order to gain more and more . They also invest their money in maybe big , new , expansive and riskful businesses . But exactly through these investments they become even more successful . Taking risks of course does not always lead to success , but the ones who try over and over again will in the end be the more successful . Without trying , you will never know if the risk you want to take may lead to more success in life . Therefore , the risk is definitely worth taking !
(HIN,high) Having a broader knowlege of many academic subjects helps a person to have a wider information of the things present in the vast world that he is lives in . It keeps him aware of the facts and helps him deal with problems with a wider perspection . On the contrary , specializing in one subject on a particular area keeps him localized and makes him narrow minded . Furthermore , it makes him lose the self confidence while dealing with situations that come to him unexpectedly . He feels enclosed and lost in this world of varieties . For instance , I have a friend whose mother is a teacher and has studied History , Geography and English . When I see her deal with the problems related any of these fields with complete easiness , it makes me feel that she is very confident of herself in whatever she does . While I also know another teacher who has specialized in biology and has confined herself to the world of biology alone . I completely agreethat it defintely is a difficult task studying a specific subject alone and specializing in it , however the advantages my friend 's mother has over her is obviously more in number . Receiving a broad knowledge on a variety of topics does not mean specializing in it on studying for it . It can also be achieved by mere reading . This is one reason why we are adviced to read newspapers . It helps us keep ourselves up dated with the incidents happening around us in this world . Reading books or magazines or any piece of article for that matter doea not go vain . Schools and colleges also include a variety of subjects for the students in their academic programs in order to make them self confident and train them to face the hardships and obstacles they will come across in their future life . I stongly feel that having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is definitely more advantageous than the specializing in only one subject . It makes a person strong and helps him live in this challenging world with full confidence .
(TEL,medium) Cars are one of the major means of transportnow a days . Many people use cars as they are more convienient means of transport . they save time and energy in reaching our destiny . But in my opinion in comming twenty years their will be fewer cars than they are now . Firstly now a days most cars run on petrol , desiel , gasoline . these are fossile fuels . Due to increase in the population over past 20 years , more cars came into market there is a great demand for the fuel . BUt the fuel reserves are limited . This leads to the shortage of the fuel in the comming years . more over due to high demand for the fuel the fuel prises will go up . The rise in the fuel prices cannot be afforded by the common man. this will make him look for other means of transportation may be public transportation such as buses , trams . Due to advancement of technology the prices of the cars decreased rapidly , this decrease in the price made comman man to own a car . As the population is increasing many people started owning a cars , this leads to the traffic congestion in the cities and towns . The presents roads may not be sufficient to accomodate the cars present , and it is difficult to expand the roads to the reqirement of the people owning the car . This leads to traffic jams and takes lots of time reaches their destination which was the advantage of owning a car . So most people will avoid cars in the comming years . Due to increase in cars the pollutions increases rapidly . there will be a lot of air pollution and noise pollution . this leads to the global warming . To avoid damange there is no other option than controlling the polution . Taking these effects into consideration the goverment may concentrate on the public means on transportation , as this saves fuel , pollution and traffic congestion . Earlier people thogth that having a car is prestige but in future they feel its head ache to own a car and maintain it , they will move for other better means of transportation in comming years .
(SPA,high) I strongly agree with this idea . I really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . If I understand an idea or concept I can really go deeply in a subject and remember it for long time . Also , I can apply that idea to other situations . On the other hand , if I just learn facts I will have just superficial knowledge and I will remember those facts for short time . Probably , it is going to be difficult for me to apply that knowledge to other scenarios . First , it is very important to deeply understand concepts and to remember them for years . From my personal experience I can say that I studied literature in high school not only reading the books but also analizing them in their context . Knowing who the author was , when the book was written , for example . With that ideas in mind I could understand better what a text said and I can still explain that topic to other people . On the contrary , I studied biology just with facts . For instance , I learnt the name of parts of the body and their location , but I never understood how they worked . If someone asks me about that field , I would have to say that I do not know much and also I do not remember even the facts . Second , I think that a good way to use the knowledge is applying it in different situations . To do that we need to understand very well what concepts we know and how they are related with others . Although we have a big list of facts , we can not use the esence of that subject in a new challenge . For example , to play the piano I have to learn how to read music . I can not just learn wich key in my piano is Do , Re or Mi . I have to understand that the notes are a representation of music and in that way it is going to be possible for me to play any piano , keybord or even othe instruments . As a conclusion I can say that if a student wants to learn , he or she has to understand the ideas and concepts first . The facts are also important , but they are nothing if the student can not explain how they are related or if he or she can just repeat words without a deep meaning behind them .
(KOR,high) Some people believe that braod knowledge of various academic subjects is more important than a special skill in one specific subject . In contrast , others think that specialized skill in a certain subject is much more profitable , because one can become the best in that certain field . I personally support the former idea , because having broader knowledge of diverse subjects indicates that this could be applied more often in reality and bring advantages when deciding one 's career . Firstly , by having diverse knowledge of various academic subjects , I can find out in which subject my talent lies . For example , one can attend numerous classes , such as mathematics , psychology , geography , biology and other . However , the person can find out that he/she is only talented in subjects like calculous and science but is terrible in biology and history classes . Thus , the person can find out where his/her talent is and be able to make clear and benefitial decision for his/her future career . Not to mention that being knowledged in various fields , one is not restricted in one area when deciding his career or talent . Moreover , people can apply their various skills in numbers of areas . Reason being , if a person is only specialized in one area , he cannot contribute to other fields of work . However , being knowledgeable in diverse areas , even when he/she faces challenging situation , the person can easilly apply his knowledge and therefore ameliorate the situaltion . Additionally , when someone is in dire need of help , the person with broad knowledge can use his surviving skills to rescue the person . In fact , knowledgeable in only one specific subject , often one cannot be well informed about what he/she must do when the person face emergency . In conclusion , even though being specialized in one specific subject is also benefitial , I believe that having broad knowledge of numerous areas is much more practical and advantageous . This is largely because , people can find out their true talent and more often apply those knowledge in reality .
(CHI,medium) Even though a guide is good for when group traveling , it is not necessary . You may save money if you do n't have a guide . A guide which make money for give informations for those areas he or she familier about , charge big number of money for their guide . Sometimes , the guide may is your friend . That way you do n't have to pay her or he . Usually , if you travel with a group since amont of people in your group every boday can give information about what they know , and where they want to travel . So they do n't need to follow the guide . That way they can save money for teps . A guide which make people lose the ability of figure out something . A guide who give you information that you want to know which make you lazy to find the result by your self . That may make people lost interest during the travel . If the guide is a stranger for you , that will make you unconfertable . while the guide who you do n't like you guide the place , you may not like the place which she or he guide because of that person . That may effect your emotion and also make your touchy temper . In a group travel most people have different ideas and favorites . One guide can not satisfy most of the visitors . The group need a guide . If the need some information they can go to the internet . In the current day there are many ways to find out the location and phone numbers etc . You do n't need a guide to tell you which place should you go and which not to go . Although the guide play some role in travel but they are not that necessary . People should make their own mind and need to challenge their own ability to find out something .
(HIN,high) I agree with the statement that , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . '' In this essay I will present a variety of reasons and examples that support my conviction . The very purpose of an advertisement is to maximize sales of a particular product . To maximize sales it is imperative to convince people to buy the product and make the product appear much better than it is . Advertisements highlight the good points of a particular product while neglecting to mention its ' bad points . Advertisements for new drugs , for instance , often highlight how a particular drug can cure a certain disease while neglecting to mention any side effects that may occur as a result of using that drug . Some advertisements advertise qualities of the product that are unlikely to be of much use . However , people may be encouraged to buy the product . For example , many car advertisements advertise the top speed of car - but who is going to drive a car at 300 km/per hour ? Other advertisements portray products as they would function under ideal conditions , without describing how they would function under conditions of common use . For instance , advertisements for mobile phones and other technological items suggest that they can function perfectly for an indefinite time period . This does not , of course consider the effect of normal wear and tear and entices people to buy them . The cleverest and often the most successful advertisements make use of subtle psychological tricks to encourage people to buy products . They do this by ascribing attributes to the product that it may , in fact , lack . Advertisements for cigarettes are a classic example . Cigarette users are depicted as fashionable and popular as opposed to those who do not use cigarettes . No company mentioned the harms of cigarettes until government regulations forced them to do so . Deodorant advertisements are another example , often suggesting that the male user of a particular deodorant would have women following him left , right and centre ! To conclude then , advertisements aim to maximize sales of products by making them seem much better than they really are . They do this in a variety of ways - examples of which I have given in the above essay .
(HIN,medium) I completaly agree with the point that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and to elplain my point here are some examples which we see in our daily life . Advertisements are to promote the products and to make the consumer feel that this is something really big for example there is a advertisement for hidden vally ranch salad dressing and it goes like this , there is a girl sitting in her dining room and she takes a bite from her salad boul . the moment she takes a bite the backgroung of her dining room change and she is presented as sitting in a garden under the tree and all is so nice and green and the weather had change after eating that salad and she is in new land and happy . The point is can any one really get transfered from a busy and stressfull life of city to a nice and pleasent life of country side ranch by just eating a salad dressing this is not true and they really make product seem better than it really is . Another example is of the the crest toothpaste in the advertisement it tell that it if u start useing the crest whiteing tooth paste ur teeths will be white as pearl in few days . But theortically it has been proven that every human being have a different color of there teeth based on the mineralization that took place during the formation of teeth , there surroundings , there genetics some tribe have whiter teeth than the other , there eating habbits etc . simply brushing the teeth will not make them pearl white . Another example is of a nutrigrain bar . In the advertisements it says that just haveing the bar will fill u with energy and u will feel really good and strong . The actor in the advertisement starts jumping and make u feel like u will be all muscular and strong by just eating one bar . Conclusion is most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and i totally agree with the point .
(FRE,medium) It hade been say , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . In this esay i will discusse about this statement , whith giving specific reasons and exemples . For student , it is not very use full to learn onlz facts . It is not the work of a student , becaus we can find it in books . Of course a student need to learn some but it is for use it no only for learning it . If a student try to learn alle facts , he can not , he have to understand it . A student make some study to improuve his knowleg , and if he onlz learn the fact and he does n't understand it he will be in great trobel when he will be supose to use it , because he will can not use it , but that what he supose to do . But on the other hand , a student who understand ideas and concepts will be a lot more beter in his work after . even so that is more dificult to understand than to learn , for exempele if you take a mathematique equation , it will be a lot more dificule to demonstrate it than to learn only the result . but after you will remamber it for a long time if zou understand it . and if a student make some study , it is for learn some thing if you just look at a book and try to remember excly like it is writen , you didi n't learn any thing , but if you work to understand ideas then you progres . In conclusion a student most understand ideas and concepts and he must not anly learn thins whith out understanding it , be
(KOR,medium) I agree with understanding ideas and concepts instead of learning facts . In the beginning of the contemporary period , people tand to teach and learn a marerial in a easy way to accept . However , this method of way to reach Ideas restricted the flexibility of thinking . Learnig only facts is the same as learnig skill . Students must learn how to use a skill instead of maintain a state of having skill . Historically admirous teacher Socrates taught his student to think them selves and find the facts or answers through their thoughts . In the example of Eignstain , he could not fit into public school . However , he found out the facts and inventied many products through his flexible ideas . Next , learning facts also influence to a person 's self-esteem . Learning at school means the same idea with solving a proplem for student . Students will experience of great achivement through solving problem . This is the process to fully understand ideas of the study . Through that experience students will le Most of people know one plus one is two . However , before learn concept of how it works , they cannot explain that it is a real fact . Now it is the era of imagine and dream . Without new ideas and concepts , not only people but also society cannot develope .
(CHI,medium) Currently , the controvesial issure of to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject urges great attention among the public and individuals . As far as I concerned , it is much intricate to draw a sweep generalized conclusion . With the diversity of the society , the demands for the diverse human resouce is required as well , meanwhile it depends on the stage and the position the person holds . From a undergraduated student 's perspective , it is obviously better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjuct . Since not only will a broader academic knowledge area bring to wider the students ' thoughts , but will help them to study their major better . Variety of academic knowledge ask people to have strong logic to view the issue , so it will help the students to view their major from different perspective . Moreover , it will provide students with a chance to find out the specific subject they desire to futher . However , for a graduated student , it is vital to be specialized . A graduated student , who is going to face the challenge of development and research in his / her major area , should have specilized knowledge structure to be responsible for the improvement of the society . At this extent , general conprehensiviation of knowledge is rather than adiquent . On the other hand , for a maneger or someone who may be high than this level , should not only be specialized in their subject but also have to have broad knowledg of many subjects . The people at this level should be more prudent in every decision they make , so they have to consider every aspect carefully before they make the decisions . As so , quiet a lot aspects require quiet a broader knowledge areas . Different people have knowledge for different intention ; different intentions give them different motivations ; different motivations bring them different interests and profits . It is impossible to cover all actors as a whole in this issure , however , as for me , a undergraduated student , to learn as many subject as I can to find the most appealing area and to understand my major knowledge futher will be my option ..
(GER,medium) Gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study . But how should a person get new information ? In my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding ideas and concepts of something . By learning facts , you can get only a small impression of how something works , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail . So by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person . When some facts are only learned they are not aquired . By knowing concepts of something the things , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge . In a lecture was sayed that a person forgets every seven years the half of its learned facts . Therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate facts from their knowledge . So a huge knowlegdege of facts can be made by understanding things . But the other direction is not easy . Another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts . So , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster . After studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts . By knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts . This ability makes researches faster an more successful .
(SPA,high) I think that the statement is wrong , not because of what it tells could be false , that could be , but because it leads to a likely huge misunderstanding . It is not difficult from the statement to infer that young people nowadays have become more selfish and less worrisome about their neighbours or communities . That is , that they ignore the meaning of the word ` solidarity ' . And the figures cannot depart from this idea . A survey conducted last year gauging the enrollment of young people in projects whose aim was to improve the quality of life of the underdogs , showed that the ratios had dramatically plummeted down during the last decade . We are unable to deny the facts , but being that said , I think that fairness should be put on stage . It may be true that young people devote less time to help people that really need assistance , but the measure is in absolute terms , not in relative ones . In order to shed some light on this topic , let us have a look around the duties a young person must face today in comparison to those faced by young people ten o twenty years ago . If we do so , we will find that it is rather difficult for a young person nowadays to find time to devote to solidarity projects . Was anybody obliged twenty years ago to speak fluently three languages to get a good job ? Was the burden of the academic studies so heavy as it is now ? An extremely competitive society has made people concentrate on themselves , rather than thinking to get their close environment better , not because of disengagement but because of obligation . This fact will fix the point . If we take a look at the number of young donors to Non Govermental Organisations ( NGOs ) we will find that the funds have soared during the last few years . If we asess the enrollment ratios in some of them , like the Red Cross , focusing on periods of vacation like the summer , we will see a similar pattern . To sum up , young people nowadays devote more time and resources to carry on projects to help their communities relative to the time they can afford . The problem is that this spare time is scarce . There is a lack of hours , not of eagerness .
(ARA,medium) Companies become more and more around the country in the last few years , and the the governments start globilaization between the countreis , and because of that the people have more chances to choose what products they think its better for them . The compaines pay alot of money to do a good advertisements so they people buy their products , and some of the people buy the product because it is cheep . I agree with the statement because that what the companies want it to be , and they dont care if their products were very good or not . Human beings all what they want is to make alot of money and get a better life and they dont have think from were they got the money . The most advertisements of products is focusing in the price because that what the poeple first look at . Thats not the company mistakes if the people think like that , and that what the company need . If u saw an advertisement the company let you think this is the great product with less price and high quality , but when you buy it you are going to see the less price but less quality , and you cant judge the company to sale it because the didnt force you to buy their products , and they will tell you if u doesnt like it there are alot of people like our product . The big probelm is when the people see alot of advertisements they got confused because they dont really which one of the companies is the right one , and alot of them they doesnt give you the high quality of the producte . What makes the companies still doing it because no one can stop then unless group of the people get sick fromm their food , at that time you are going to see the whole newspaper is talking about the company and what the have done .
(KOR,medium) People have their own idea whether youth do not give much time to help their neighborhoods . Some people may say that in these days , some young people do not have enough time to help others . In my opinion , however , young people do not give time to help others : they focus on their own things and they are more busy than past younger . First , young people have to concentrate on only their works . It is generally agreed that young people can not avoid any competitions such as have a job or enter the university . Therefore , young people do not have enough time to help other people . For example , if they do not focus on their tasks , they cannot survive in modern society . Having a job is the very important thing in their life . They must think only their works for their future . In this way , younger people cannot have time to help others . Second , modern society makes young people busy . Some people might think that young people have a lots of spare time such as vacations . However , lots of people enjoy their life at an early age because if they get older they cannot have much time to enjoy their life . For instance , young people make plan at long vacation . They can go abroad or thay can study other major which young people want to learn . In this way , young people nowadays cannot spend their spare time helping their communities . To sum up , young people do not have time to help their communities . They have a lot things to do and they must enjoy their time when they are young . All things considered , I can definetely say that youth have difficulty in having time to help their neighbors .
(FRE,medium) First , we have to analize what is a successful person . In a general way , it is somebody who realize something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way . Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful ? Is it necessary to show all those vertues to be successful ? Is it the only condition to be successful ? In one hand , successsful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful . So , it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful . In the other hand , somebody may have a lot of vertues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized . It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like basejump , but without being outstanding and recognized , this person is not yet successful , only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful . The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those vertues . First , a successful person can show only one of those vertue and be successful . Somebody creating new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks . And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member , and then becoming famous and successful . Finally without any of those vertues , somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful . We have seen that success is not related to the vertues enounced in the statement . Then , I would say that anybody can be successful , however it is not linked to any will of the person but it is due to other factor dependant on environment . In spite of the possible random of the success , the person must act in a certain manner to attract the success knowing that could be in vain .
(HIN,high) Well , according to me it depends on the real time situation . Sometimes its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one subject . For example to make a living a person should be able to adapt himself in any kind of working atmosphere . Suppose , Mr.X has done his graduation in say , chemical engineering , it does'nt guarntee him a job in chemical or any related industry cause its hard to get a job in the chemical industry as the number of employees required are fewer compared to the It industry . If Mr.X has learnt basics about computer , which is usually thought in undergraduation school , then his chance of getting a job in a IT industry is more compared to chemical . IT industry do require chemical engineers to deal with the clients related to chemical background and he can do a great job in understanding the problems of the client . So , his broad knowledge about all his academics subject can get him a job . One more example , lets talk about a paediatrician , a person ( doctor ) specialized to treat children problems . Well he is much more familiar to diseases of a child than a grown up . Suppose , he is travelling in a train , and suddenly there 's some problem to an accompaning passenger who is a grown up/elder person . As a doctor his duty is to look at the problem of the person rather than saying i 'm a child specialist . At this instance of time a broad knowledge on his academic subjects could help give a immediate initial remedy to the person before he is taken to a hospital . At times you need to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge about all his academic subjects . For example a person specialized in nuclear engineering and working in a nuclear power plant . Well , its a must to have a specialization in that one subject subject rather than having a broad knowledge about his other academic subjects like sugar technology , petroleum engg .. , etc. , Because he is responsible for the processes going on in the plant , and any problem can cause great havoc . At this situation its worth to have a specialization in one subject . I , conclude by saying that it really depends on the job , the atmosphere one is working into have specialization in one subject or to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
(SPA,high) I must totally disagree with the given statement . In my opinion , in twenty years we will still be using cars as our main way of transport . I will try to summarize the different arguments that I think are essential for supporting my posture . First of all , evidence shows that countries and cultures of the second and third world are beginning to be a relevant party in the car market , as we may see in countries like China or India , which are even developping their own industry , producing cheap cars for the populations of their countries . This will evidently result in a relevant rise in the number of cars , as most of these countries have large populations . Secondly , even if some may say that public transport in western countries has been trying for years to be a subsitute for cars , the truth shows that families spend more money than ever in the purchase of cars , and many of them own more than one , or even two cars . In addition , and as a consequence of the recent rise in oil prices , many car-industries are launching models called `` hybrid '' , whose main characteristic is that they do not depend totally on petrol , but combine fuel with other alternative sources of energy , like water , electric batteries or even litter . As this models begin to spread all around the world , the problem of the oil prices will be partially solved , and the pollution that is today affecting our environment will diminish . Last but not least , fliying has turned over the past years into a more than unconfortable way of travelling . Due to current world instability and to international terrorism , many people prefer not to take a plane if possible , not only because the fear of an attack , but because the security controls and the more and more frequent baggage losses . This means that many people would travel by car when possible , even if this results in longer hours . As we can see , there are strong arguments that support this opinion , and even if some may hope that cars , and therefore traffic and stress , may someday disappear , it does not seem to bother most of us .
(SPA,medium) In now a day sociaty , academic is more and more important , everywhere is looking for a high level academic school or college , but if we enter a better academic institude , are we going to be genios or having more ability for sure ? The main function of school and college is to prepared men , but they ca n't make one 's decision , For example , a man is going to studied in a high academic college but he does n't like to study , all he wants is to meet people and have a good time . These '' decision '' is from his only purpose and not by the college . deciding which academic subjects to pick is depending on every single person . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is reasonably , how could a man known everything little by little but when he is in front of a very specific problem , what is he going to do ? For example , an high school teacher is in her house , what is she going to do if suddenly her computer does n't work and she need to work on her job ? Maybe she know how to fix it , but if not ? she is just only a high school student . In the other hand , if specialize in one specific subject , there are were some unespecific things that one man does n't know its like he ca n't resolve a simply problem . Every subject has they own advetage or disadvatage one subject is depended on another , so i will agree with borad knowledge
(TUR,high) It is asked whether grasping the idea and concepts are more valuable than learning and just memorizing the facts . I hold the view that , although sometimes it is useful to learn the facts , to be able to understand the idea and the underlying reasons behind a particular topic is far more crucial . The students should be expected more than learning the facts and ways of critisizing these facts should be taught them . To begin with , I believe that the facts do not always remain constant . They can change with time and old facts can be replaced with completely new facts . Thus , the facts itself are not always reliable . To illusrate it with an example , before Galileo and some other scientists it was believed that the world was flat . Besides , it was a well accepted fact . However , later the facts were questioned and replaced with newer facts . What I can recommend here is that learning the ways which go to these facts are more important and the ideas and concepts behind these facts form a more solid understanding for the students . Secondly , the facts are usually more difficult to keep in mind . Since I am also a student , I know very well that the facts are easily forgotten after one year or even after the courses finish . Thus , to understand ideas would enable the students to carry their knowledge to their later periods of life . Besides , focusing on the concepts and general ideas would also enable them to study more effectively , since they are usually more easy to remember . Thirdly , the facts do not prepare the students for a real life at all . Usually at school , the students just keep the facts in mind , which are explained by the teacher . Later on , the students just memorize the facts in order to be ready for the exams and they usually do not grasp the topic as a whole or they cannot add something from themselves . However ; when these students will graduate afterwards and will be in the real life , they will be expected to be able to interpret , to make comments and to offer new solutions based on basic ideas and concepts . Therefore at school , the students should be trained and encouraged to question the facts and offer alternatives to these facts . That is often a more effective way of education than learning the facts . In conclusion , I support the idea that to understand the ideas and concepts is more crucial than just trying to keep the facts in mind . There is no guarantee that the facts would remain as they are and a student should learn to do more than just memorizing the facts in order to be ready for a life outside of school when they graduate . Thus , students are better encouraged to understand the ideas and concepts and be able to critisize the facts , which I think is more important than the facts .
(ITA,medium) I agree with the statement : usually advestisements make products seem much better than they really are . I also think that in many cases this beviour is an illegal way to send a product to normal people . In fact , many times advertisements involve situations that are bild to hit particular groups of people , like children or old persons . Children are one of the favourite targets for advertisements , because they want to be socially accepted by other children and usually this means that they want clothes , games and other things similar to those that the others have . Parents know that many of those things do n't correspond to real desires of their sons , but they ca n't say ` No ' in front of many requests , because it is very important to be accepted by the other children . For this reason , many advertisements are prepared for children and they usually show products that are n't good as it seems in television , or on a newspaper . An example are toys : in Italy , many years ago , a very important company started selling electronic games , by mail . In television they showed a particular product , that was nice and interesting , and many families bougth it . The problem started when families recived it by mail : the game was n't the one they had seen on television , it was shorter and very difficult to be played . Also old peolple are good targets for fake advertisements , because they are weak and unable to realize what they are going to buy . An example : my grandmother bougth a radio , that she had seen on a newspaper , and when she recived it , by mail , she realized that it did n't work .
(JPN,medium) I disagreee this statement . Because , I think it depends on people . I take one example and approach this problem . Now I live in Tokyo with my grand mother . Her name is Kazuko . She is 68 years old . Usually over 60 are rentnerin and have no work . But she is still worker . She works in drug store . Every day she gets up early and leaves house . And she goes back to home late . I thougt that hard working is difficult for her . So I asked her `` Such a hard working is difficult is n't you ? '' `` No , it is enjoyable !! '' She said . I was surprised to hear that . She continued . `` Once I retired . But then I was at a loss what should I do . And I had a boring life . After that I determined I work again !! '' Generally speaking I think a lot of people assume `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . But strictry speaking , it is nonsense . Thinking `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is neglect to older people , I think !! Now I 'm second grade university student and major in English literature . When I was a freshman , I majored in Gerrman literature . It was boring for me.so thenI did n't enjoy life . But I decided changing my major and could achieve this desire . So now I am enjoying my daily life !! Conclusion states that `` Enjoying life '' does n't matter age !! Thank you !! That 's all !!
(ARA,medium) I do not agree nor disagree with the statement . Traveling with a group led by a toure guide is intresting , the tour guied will stat information about the place we are visiting , so we can get knowledge on the place . Also he is an expert with the famous places which attract visitores from different countries , so we can denifit from his expierience . Furthermoe , we will guarantee that we did not miss anyplace with in the tour . The beautiful part in traveling with group is we can share information about different cltuers from people all over the world . i like to learn about cultures it is very intresting to find that some beleives that are forbbiden in some cultures are allowed in others , therefore when people visit other countries will knoe how to react with some people . For example certain words are allowed to be used in me country but not allowed in other contries , so when I visit that other country I would say a wored that would cause a big trouble for me On the other hand , when traveling in a group the individuals will be tied up with the group , sometimes we need to spend some family time to explore the country weare visiting and try some restaurants , spend more time in a musiem and buy some sevoniers . In my opinion I will try both traveling ina group led by a tour guide or travel alon with my family , because each one of them has its own experience and adventure that we can keep wonderfull memorise in our mindes , i would like in some day to visit all the lovley places that i heard from people . Each individual has a different point of view , and every person will make the right selection for themselves to enjoy what they can to make good times las
(KOR,medium) I agree with that fact the most advertisements products seem much better than they really are . It has to be that way , would you want to buy anything that does n't look good or seems not useful ? Like it says , it 's `` advertising '' . For example , the M'c Donald 's Big Mac seems really big , yummy , and tasty but the real Big Mac is n't really that big as showing as an advertising . They just put more stuff to make it look bigger and use frash ingrediants for the advertising . If it does n't seem like that big and tasty , people wo n't want to eat . It 's all about the advertising that people want to eat and buy things . And also , I think the better advertising satisfy people 's mind . For example , on the car advertising , who does n't want to buy nice Mercedes or BMW ? but all the poeple ca n't afford them . When you look at the Honda Civic 's advertising , it looks fancy as Mercedes , too . You know it 's not that fancy or nice as them but you just look at the advertising and satisfy yourself . The advertising uses certain places , models , concepts , lightings , and ect , to make the product look better . On the clothing advertising , someone who extreamly georgous model wearing silk coctail dress , you would want to buy it . That 's what models are for . In conclusion , the adversitings are not lying but it just has to be look good . That 's what advertisings are for .
(HIN,high) Well i agree with the statement . Young poople do actually enjoy life more than older people . Its important here to define what one mean by `` enjoyment '' . If one means that enjoyment means having your dream car , more money to spend , going to late naight parties and clubs , then yes youths are indeed at an advantage because they have the youthfull energy and charisma and are not prone to health problems as older people are usually prone to . But if one defines enjoyment as having peace of mind , relaxation and trouble free life then there cant be happier retired person whose son stays with him and who has all the time in the world to play with his 1 yr old grandson . Young people have the advantage of flexibility . They can adapt to a new situation more easily than old people who usually become reserved with age . If you have to shift from one city to another , as a youth you will be able to adjust very easily to the new city and start enjoying your life but as an oldie you wont be able to come to the terms of the new city and make new friends easily . The most important factor is of health . Old age often brings many diseases along with it . And as one grow old he 's bound to have one or the another disease . This health factor also contributes a lot to the fact that older people dont enjoy much because even if they are youthful at heart , they cant be physically because their health wont permit . Science and technology have become internal parts of our life . Every day there are new gadgets to be found in the nearby store and very quickly they make way into our homes . Internet has shrinked the world but the its the youth that are making the most use of it . Todays youth is more technically inclined and he knows how to make the best use of the technolgy that is being discovered and enjoys it to its fullest . The problem with older people is that they are not that much technically inclined and as a consequence are not inclined towards such gadgets which would make there life more enjoyable .
(ARA,medium) I agree with this statment , becuase noadays young people are occupied or distract by other thing for example vidoe games . dating girls , the internet , movies , concerts the list goes on and on . Young people today are not that interested in thier communities all they are interested in is fun stuff thing that are not complicated or stressing , they think becuase they are young they have the rest of their lives to worry about the commuinty , yong people like the fact that they should n't care about their community when they are young . Thier perents are the blame becuase they are most of the time telling them that stuff in the commuinty doesnot concern them . firstly young people these days think it is okay not to care about their community and that they shouldnot be more involved becuase they are not mature enough or have n't experieced life long enough , or the fact that their opiniuon is not vaild becuase they are not old enough . Secondly their perents should engourage them to be more involved and not to pay alot of that attention to movies or girls , that attention should be directed in a more useful way that they should use all the knowledge they have to help and improve thier community . Their perents send them to school to learn and get a good education for them to leaders and help and improve countries and commuinties . they should n't waste that on thing that are not useful or helpful in any way . finally i would like to encourage the young people of today to study hard and be more involved with your community and use all the knowlgde they got and put it to good use and help their commuinty .
(CHI,medium) Some people like hold the opion that learn ideas and concepts is much important than learn facts , even though teachers and parents . But in my opion , I would prefer that learn facts is more important than just learn ideas and concepts . Beacuse the facts can be clearly and deeply unserstand that what is the real thing . Firstly , facts are more clearly unserstand when you learn something . If you learn facts that makes you really clearly about the article , you can know about the heart of the article . Ideas and concepts just points in the articl or news when you learn in the classroom . For example , when you first see the articl or news which you will find main ideas and expalin points . You just learn about the face . You just learn how to write a normal writing . Also like the words and some beautiful sentences . In the classroom , some theachers just teach about consistant . What is article , how to write article , remember the beautifu words and sentences . Sencondly , did you know what is author what to say ? It 's not ideas , concepts and beautiful words . The articls just want people understands that what they want say , which is the most important problems in the world . Some articl is writing about that they want people pay attention the problem . But they did n't pay attention about the article 's sprit . And if you understand facts which you will learn more abou the article , it 's make depply for you understand the article . In sum of , you must cleal \ rly and depply
(TEL,medium) I agree this point that it is more important for students to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Because understanding concepts make them to deal with the problems which are occured with that particular concept . Let us take one example by learning the concept of computers we may able to use it in an efficient way . we are also able to deal the probles found with it . Only the person who knows about the computers can only deal with it . By knowing the concepts we are able to have good ideas about developing that concept . And we can creat a new concept . We are well experienced by knowing the concept Concept undertanding makes us to have more command and control over a concept than learning facts . We do not get experienced by learning facts . we only know about the thing and working about it . But knowing the concept we know the process of it and internal structure of it . By understanding the concept we can even try to work with the other fields for example . If a person knows about the programming language ` C ' he can also try to work with ` JAVA ' because some syntax are same in both of the languages . We cannnot have an idea by learning facts . they remain unchanged even after the many years . We may have new ideas by understanding concepts . We also become experts in taht particular field . By understanding the concept there is no scope of forgetting it . So i suggest students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
(TEL,high) I disagree with the statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Today due to vast expansion of infrastructure and man power , specializing on a particular subject would lead to a positive and creative solutions . The globalisation which is rapidly growing across the globe requires totally refined finished products unlike expecting for conventional products in the primitive times . This statement can be clearly explained with the help of an example , lets take civilengineering into account , civil engineering is an unision of 6 areas of specialization namely foundation engineering , structural engineering , environmental engineering , construction planning and management , water resources engineering and transportation engineering . If we try to gain a broad knowledge of all these subjects it would be difficult for an engineer or a researcher in these fields to deliver a refined design which would suit the present trend . This is because all the fields of specialisation mentioned above are entirely different from each other . The foundation engineering deals with foundation design , structural engineering deals with the super structure design and in this way each has its own entity , so a good engineer having a sound knowledge in any one area can excel in that field and would be able to deliver all the requirements needed in that specific field . Taking highway engineering into consideration , its totally distinct from other fields as it deals with pavement design and harbour design . Hence for an efficient engineer or a researcher in this field would be able to derive better designs from the knowledge he gained through this specialized field . In the similar way an environmentalist could give proper suggestions on air , water and marine pollutions more effectively than a person having a broad knowledge in this field . The branch of civil engineering is just an example to explain why gaining knowledge in a particular specialization is needed rather than gaining broader knowledge in all the fields . The strong belief which is coming from our primitive ages that , its better to concentrate on one particular thing rather than putting hands in various fields in order to get positive results . This conceptual belief proves that `` old is gold '' and is very much applicable in the present scenario as each and every individual is aiming for an accurate result in all the fields . This belief can also be explained by a concept called `` SIX SIGMA '' , this concept is used in firms which produce goods of various kinds , the accuracy level achieved through this concept is that only one part produced is proven to be defective in 1 million parts produced . This accuracy level is achieved through rigorous research and effort made by technologists in this particular field . Hence I strongly believe and personally commit to the comment that having specialized in a particular subject fetch excellent and innovative results rather than gaining broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
(SPA,medium) Knowing a lot of academic subject or just knowing one specific subject . If you want to be call inteligent , you should learn a lot of academic subjects because you migh fit in every conversation , but if you want to be the kind of person that is reconize for what they know , you should learn just one academic subject . If you decided to be the intelligent guy , you stared learning a lot of subjests , so you migh look brilliant , but in the other hand , when you learn that much , you are just doing that because you want to be the brilliant guy , the one that knows everything , not the one that loves what he do . However , if you chose to be the guy that learned just one subject you migh love , what you do , and you would be really happy . But unfortunally you migh not look as brilliant as the guy that choose to learn a lot of subjects because when it cames to have a conversation , you maybe do n't know what to talk about it . Althouth , when it cames about somenthing respect to your subject , everyboby would be surprice to see how much do you know , and you migh develop a invention about your subject because you know a lot about it . In conclucion i think that it is better to learn one subject really good than learn 100 subjects badly , because if we think about all the invention that have been made for people that know everything about the subject they are working on it , not jut a little bit about everything .
(SPA,low) For the last decades society has been suffering the opposite way of `` humanities '' conducts that were lived specifically in the 16th and 17th centuries , where people cared for others , for humanity , that 's why was created the `` Humanism '' . The actual problem is the specialization of subjects that cut off the human relationships . Instead of care by the person who lives close to us , we care more to know the reason of the molecular existance , for example . What I want to say is that in the way we obtain more broad knowledge of academic and cultural subjects , we could be better persons in society because we 'll understand those who are the same as us and we also be capable to understand the problems we have as society . It is part of an open-minded education that the study of a specific subject could n't bring . To preserve peaceful relationships between different cultures , nations and between different personalities , as society we should perform educational curriculums that waranty a broad knowledge education .
(CHI,medium) Successful people are really try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . We live in an amazing world . Things change , people change . How could be successful if you just go along the road that all the people already know how to do well . Yes , it 's true that some things and rules are still right . People need to eat everyday , so I open a resteraunt . So how could not I make money . But when others run it too , how could you make sure that you can still make money . So you need to change , you need to try new things , you need to take risks , or others will change , and then , you just destroy yourselves . Who knows that computers will become extremely popular several decades ago . And people just thought that the Bill Gates person was so stupid . What if he go and see and do some law things his fathers just wished rather than trying new things and take the big risks to go on with his computer and softwares . Well we may ca n't fly into the sky some years ago , but after the brothers used their lives to take the risk , you see what we can do now . No risks , no win . That 's our Chinese old words . Without the risks , how could we see the new country in the north Ameria land . Maybe some works do not change , but the way we do them must be changed . If there are no the new things , how could the world develop itself . All the things are still same as a couple of years ago , the shop is still the shop , the stuffs you can buy are still them , I can not imagine that .
(ITA,high) The goal of advertisement is to attract people to buy a product , and therefore they make look the products better than they are . I agree with that , and I will explain with some pratical examples this theory . Most commercials are these days shown on tv , the biggest mass media that we know . Specified products are sponsorized between certain hours , for example , during a cartoon show generally are sponsored products for kids . At night , depending on the movie playing , the commercials change too . If it 's a romantic movie , we are most likely to see commercials for products that are used by women , or if it 's an action movie the target is the male gender . Some products , such as lingerie , tend to show perfect female bodies in order to attract both sexes . Women will be incentivated to buy it because they will find themselves attractive as the models , and men will connect that image to a sexual pleasure . Sex is , in fact , part of our instinct , and that 's where the advertisement are made to hit . Another area where we are more sensible is food , but it 's a more delicate subject , because women want to lose weight in a healthy way , while men focus more on the taste . This way , it 's very important to advertise a food that both men and women like , not considerating the children . Since we have been bombarded of images of perfect bodies , houses , family , lives ... the new commercials are trying to give more of a realistic image ( without losing that aura of magic ) , therefore we still will see beautiful women , but maybe in company of not as that attractive men , making feel the buyers at the same level as them , and not anymore looking at these `` gods '' as inaccesible . But the new target of advertisement are the children , since they are left more and more in front of the television , and also because generally in the families they have the control of the remote . Anyway , I think that a more specified type of advertising , focused on a restrained target , is yet more effective , but it 's more dangerous because it 's reaching some levels never seen before . We are always looking for the latest status symbol , which is normally a very fancy and useless gadget , but I 'm afraid that is too late to go back . The only thing that I suggest is to reduce the amount of commercials , because honestly , I think that all of us are sick of them .
(FRE,high) It is generally agreed that the younth enjoys life more than the older generation does . However , I will explain why I am not a strong advocate of this belief . Firstly , most students have a lot of work to do for their studies . As a student in an engineering school , I have to work a lot in order to pass my exams . I donot have too much time to spend with my friends . My parents have more time to invite friends and to attend to cultural events . I am looking forward to having as much free time as they do . A lot of retired people are in a good shape and are travelling a lot to discover the world . I am personally convinced that many of them are enjoying life more than I do . It should also bear in mind that when we have a job in a company , we are independant and it is for me a top priority . We have the opportuny to spend our money as we wish . We can set up a family and spend a nice time with our children . I woud really appreciate to bring up my chidren and to do my best to enable them to be well educated . I know that before this , I will have to work very hard to be allowed to go to the universty of my dreams . Above all , it should not be brushed under the carpet that many young people suffer from the lack of assistance . Some of them even commit suicide . Also , some teenagers have to face drug problems that have tremendous effects on their health . I think that much remains to be done to decrease the rate of these dramatic addictions . To conclude , I back that young people do not always enjoy life as much as the older generation d. I think that authorities should focus more on the ways to help more the younth .
(FRE,medium) Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . This statement is very true successful people are always taking risks trying new things but this is what make those person successful . If someone is successful in something and keep on doing only what they already know how to do , well he will never learn more and will stay in the same place he is . The person who will be trying new things will stard to be more successful because he will be good in new things he tried so he will know how to do more things well . This is the way this person will be more successful than the other one that just kept on doing what he use to know and did not try to learn more things . If you look at the people who are around you , you will see that the person who are always doing new things will have a lot more problems to resolve than person who stay doing what he knows . This is for sure but resolving those problems the person learn more and more , this is the way he will stard to do the new thing and to know how to do it . Well if you can tell this person who is always taking those risks are successful . The reason is that not all the new things he tried worked but a lot of them did work . It is a very good sentence that I like a lot that say : `` How do you want to get fish if you do not get your feet wet '' . The successful person is who get her feet wait to get some fish . This is a very true sentences you have to get wet to get what you want and most of the person want success in life . I agree that if you want to be successful you have to take risks trying new things this is why person who take risks tring are successful .
(TUR,low) My grandfather was always said to me ; ? f you wanna swimm , then go to the occean rather than the pole . At that time i didnt understand what does it mean . But after many years , when I came in a big city and saw many succesfull people , I understood that ; curoisity , hardworking , good planning , and risk taking are common factors of succesfull people . At first sight , doing same things seem maybe easy , compfortable and safe . But after a while it ll be boring . and you fell yourself probably lonely and unuseful . On the otherhand ; If you are curios people , you ll decline to always try to find new things . That makes you happy and ensure you selfconfidence which is very important of success . But trying to find new things and curiostiy are not enough for success . You should also make a good plan and hardworking on it . Finally risktaking . I think ? ts the most important thing for suceess . Everybody can work hard and make a good plan . But too few people can take risks to implement in real life .
(TUR,medium) Television or the other machines which effect the people are become ilisionist . Because its effect the human thinking ability . Manypeople start to buy products from internet or television . And some company which produce advertisement effect human . Their startegy is produce useless product but it sell as a good thing . Many of the people can not understand the diference between good product and useless product when they are watching television . As we know worl trade bacame very dangerous and wild many of the country produce sama product . For example China 's industry capacity bacome larged more than many years ago . Chinase idustry produce many things for example motorcycle but companies which import them from china have maden good advetisement to some advertisement company . This company make many interesting advertisement for that product . And people start to buy that product that product 's cost less than other counties product for example japan or italian . there is no difference between these two product its kook same . Because of this people intend to buy that products . Its cost is half than other but lifecycle is the same . People can not use that product efficiently . After some times later the product become useless but other products which products in other country is continued to use by the people . But at tha same time advertisiment is the most important part of the selling . if some products have not good advertisiment , it can not be sold . There are many huge relations between products and advertisement . But company or some people use these relation as as a bad effect to the people . Many people use internet for buy somethig or they look products catalog from internet . Although internet is the best technological platform in the world . people use it as a advertisemental thing . As we know advertesiment is the most effective way to selling products an people .
(GER,medium) When you ask me , if I agree or disagree this statement my answer would be : both . On the one hand are many young people active community-members . They help for an example in sportclubs , take care of older people or are in a political party . All these activities support the community . On the other hand many young people do n't care about the community . They are a kind of egoistic and the reasons vary . Often you hear from young people that they do n't have enough time to help their community , because they have a lot of work to do . But I think this is not the entire truth . Some people are afraid of taking responsibilty for something or ca n't act in teams . Moreover they are thinking only of time or money and forget that it can be a great feeling to help others . Mostly these people are great critics but they do n't try to improve things by helping . My guess is they are lazy too . Advantages of helping in your community are that you meet interesting people and learn some skills , like speaking in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you . Although it cost you some leisure it can be fun . In summary I think it `` s good for your community as well as for your character to say yes to a task and help in a community .
(SPA,low) I agree with that , it is better to travel with a tour guide that travel alone . It is less expensive that travel alone because you always pay for the hole trip ( if you pay to a travel agengy for the trip you pay all inclusive : the plane , the tikets , the hotels , the food and they give you the tour guide and the security ) You do n't enjoy alone . You are always with peoples . You are always sharing , speeking , talking , laughing . You are never bored . If you go to an interest place the travel guide are going to explain you the history of that place , why they construct that monument , what means , etc . If you do n't speak the language of that country the tour guide can help you to understand the language or he can translate you whatever you want . You ca n't loose , because they are always taking care of you . They are going to help you with anything information that you need . The tour guide is always nice , if they work alone they will give you the best price ( for you choose them ) . I think that it is a good option for not travel alone . The tour guide is a person that knows a lot about the place that you are visiting in that moment . He is worried about you . He can help you in save your money . They are honest people . Many works for the government too ( in my country you will see tours guides that are paying for the government ) . I do n't a
(KOR,medium) I have seen many different advertisement from the watching television . There are many different commercials on the TV . The variety number of company or government use advertisement for sales or give informations . Back in this summer , I was in Korea for visiting my family and staying around for 3 months . I was watching television program called `` Home Shopping '' . The program shows diversed items everyday , all the time . While I was watching the Home Shopping program , I started getting into it . I realized that the advertisement made me to buy items even if I do n't need it . Why it happends ? Advertisement is a way of businesses increase their sales of items . It 's very simple . The company needs to sell their goods as much as they can . The advertisement is a good way of increase their sales because it is easy for the people to contact and get informations . For increasing their sales , the commercial has to be mysterious or interesting . It causes people to have interest in their goods . Many people gets hurt or regrets of their deal because advertisement make products look much better than what they really are . When I was 9 years old , I really wanted new shoes even though I had a brand new shoes . It was not because of I hated my shoes . It was because of the advertisement . The commercial advertising the shoes with my favorite animation . I affected commercial . I cajoled mother to get one of those shoes . I finally got the shoes but I definately not used it occastionally . I also wanted remote controll cars . I was entrancing in the advertisement . It looked amazing . I thought I will be really happy if I get one . I asked parents but they ignored . I cajoled mother to buy one for me . She spent a quiet money for that . She spent money for me even though we were not very wealthy . I was having great time with it for couple days , but I apparently got sick of it . It looked amazing in commercial , but the car was not really amazing at all . I felt guilty and wasteful .
(FRE,high) I agree with the statement according to which most advertisements make products seem much better than really are . I have often made the experience of disappointment in front of a real item that I had only seen on a television screen or on a billboard . And for sure , I am not the only one to come to the conclusion that advertisement is just about misrepresentation . Every day , one has the occasion to see , for example , a poster that presents the wonderful characteristics of some new beauty cream and the terrific effects it will have on the reduction of lines and dark circles . The fact is that the efficiency of such potions have never thoroughly been proved , and that their using has never prevented anyone from reading the traces of time on the face of an old woman . But nowadays , advertisement is a necessary evil in consumer societies . Indeed , the goal of producers is to sell more and more every day . Advertisers are hired to achieve this goal . They try to present the product so as to create a desire , even a longing for it , so that people buy it as soon as they can . They repeat the operation in order to accelerate the process , and to earn more money . Advertisement , then , necessarily uses spectacular words and emphatic images to make people dream . Advertisement , for some people , only sell dreams . Hence the habitual disappointment when consumer face products as they really are . Advertisement then is often a legal issue . The problem consists in knowing if the advertisement is mere puff and blow , or if it really corrisponds to a visaul form of contract . If such was the case , the advertiser would maybe be liable for making a fraudulent misrepresentation , and one could clame for damages .
(TUR,low) I disagree . In an academic subject you have to specialize in one spesific subject . In an academic career you have to improve yourself in one topic . Your knowledge have to be more specialized than ordinary people . Honestly broad knowledge is an asset for an academic career but it is not enough . In academic subjects you have to your own thesis , hypothesis , researchs and also stastistical results on your subject to promote . Academicians are the people who leads to the society . By their opinions and knowledge our life become more qualified . For that reason they have to be specialized in one spesific subject . University life and enviroment has to supply them all the equipments they need to specialize . Broad knowledge in many academic subjects , supports to discuss and create new things but not enough . All over the world assistants and professeurs are remembered by their research reports and thesis , they have to work hard and help each other by sharing their researchs . To find out something we have to focus on a spesific subject like Einstein , Archimedes .
(HIN,high) IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING IDEAS AND CONCEPTS TO LEARNING THE FACTS Yes , I do agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more to be stressed upon than learning the facts . The `` ideas '' are ones individual 's . And `` concepts '' are formed on the basis of the depth of research on a topic or a statement . Concepts are the basic and easiest way to approach any diversity of topics . It helps to comprehend the subtle nuances conveyed in the text . Once formed they cannot be shifted into a new frame unless otherwise proved through years of regular study . As an example Newton gave three theories of motion after proved and approved by other scientists also . Einstein thought why an apple falls on the Earth downwards from the top of a tree . He did not accept this as a fact but worked on it and improvised a mathematical approach to it . It was an idea that was hitting his mind and at last he came over with a genuine proof for it . '' Ideas give birth to new inventions '' . It is best said by some body . It is just important that how seriously we study on the topic and how far we prove them to be correct in a more logical way . Learning facts is least important . It is simply getting the things into your heads without giving a thought to it . It is called `` cramming '' . Yes , one must be aware of the facts but reasoning is equally important . One must not learn but abserve them , analyse them and reason them so hat the same previously learnt concep can be applied without any panick . Ideas and concepts are the basis to learning the newer and inventing the newer technologies . Facts can be created as many times as we desire from its basic root . The beautiful boulevard of life is full of new experiences that further forms the learning or a concept . Just enjoy the new experiences giving a logical thought to it .
(HIN,high) The topic `` whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or have specialised knowledge '' is subjective . In my opinion having specialised knowledge is more important than having little knowledge of every field . I support my opinion by an adage `` jack off all and master of none '' as per the adage a person who knows bits and pieces of all the subjects but does not have complete knowledge of one field end up knowhere . A specialisation is must because if person tends to select a career path the he must be focused on following it , he must be able concentrate on his or her desired field without bieng distracted by other influences , For example many people tend to switch careers because the pay is good or work is less taxing , they tend to obtaind knowledge of other areas which may be beneficial , but as trends change the motivation also change . i.e if the particular field gets to crowded then people tend again to switch their area of expertise . In doing so people may intially get better pay for their skill in different departments , but when it comes to progress they may find themselves at lower postion then if they had specialised in a particular area and waited for better opportunities Secondly having broad range of knowledge in itself is not detrimental If a person is able to keep with developments and progresses that are being made , In this fast changing world thing get outmoded quickly for eg in the it world people tend learn a lot new computer languages but as technologies develop some of them get outdated So a person must be able to keep up with progress . Having said this , it is not humanly possible for each human being to keep himself updated with myriad of changes taking place in limited time he has each day Thirdly it is not only the knowledge in the different academic fields that matter it is the application of the knowledge practically that matter If a person is not able to apply himself or use a skill practically than the skill is worthless For eg if a person has knowledge in the following areas computers , medicine , law : all disparate field with little or no relation to each other and he cannot repair a computer when the situation demands or save a person when he is ill then the knowledge in different areas is of no use unless he able to do complete justice to all the fields Having said this having basic knowledge in some fields which is required for day to day functioning is good for eg basic computer knowledge is required in almost all offices in addition to basic knowledge it is necessary that person must specialise in particular area so that he can continue to prove his worth to employer and continue to progress in his carees In conclusion It is better to specialise in particular academic subject than to try to gain knowledge of all areas and as result end without proper direction to one career specialisation bring a sense of accomplishment which diversifying cannot
(GER,high) The issue at hand is whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today . The question is very interesting since the number of cars used have a tremendous influence on our environment because of the pollution . I personally believe that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than today . The first reason I think this is because the number of people who can afford a car is constantly growing . Although we do n't know how the economical structure will look like in twenty years we have to expect that in the big countries like China and India more people will earn enough money to buy a car for their personal need . Another reason why I assume that more cars will be on the road is based on the assumption that the people 's search for individualism is constantly growing . Many people do n't want to be limited by public transportation to get to their destinations . They use their car to travel whenever they want to the places they would like to be . They 're not limited by timetables or the locations of the train/bus stations . My final thought which supports my opinion is that cars are also a sign of wealth . In contrast to the people who can afford one car for their personal transportation there will be many people who earn enough money to have even more than one car and that only for the purpose of fun . There are a lot of couples without children who have 3 cars . One car for each person for the daily use and the third car , for example a sports car or a convertrible car , for special occasions . There are also a lot of collectors of very old cars , called oldtimers . Concluding the arguments above I can say that we should definitely expect more cars on the road in twenty years than today .
(JPN,low) I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . It is because advertisements are always things that for seems very much better , and increase value and sell . However , I think it is not so bad because advertisements has to be better than real products . If advertisement of products seems not so attractive , people would not buy them . Besides , if advertisments were not much better than real products , the costomer of products 's social would begin to complaning . then advertiser would lost his or her job . For example , Sample food . It makes of just prastics , but it is so attractive for costomers . However , I have never seen that someone clame to restaurants . It is because people understand Sample food seems better than real food . For these reasons , I agree that most advertisement make pro
(TEL,medium) I completely agree with the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' because the fact that people like to enjoy more comforts and the improment thing is that the technology is increasing enoromously in the day to day life which can make more nu . I support the statement because of the following considerations which i have taken into consideration . The first consideration is that man wants to enjoy comforts and is one of my mojor considerations . It is because the bikes cannot support the driver in all the case , that is in the rainny seacon , winter season . and the driver wants a him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition . this is the first a person wants to have a car . And the second reason is that it would be more safer than bikes because he can keep the temperature of his car according to his will and his comfort while the person riding a bike cannot do . And the other reason I would to support my statement is that the cost of the car . The cost of the cars have been decrease now a days because of the growth in the technology . Now a days the car makers are improving their technology so that the car would of least expenditure , so that there would be more people to by their car . If we compare the number of the cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars have deen increased , wide variety of cars are now pr4esent in the market and also the feature the the car should have is also improved a lot . Also the lowest cost of the car in these 20 years have been decreased to a major extent . So I totally support the above statement and I can say conformly that the rising technology will give the future a better car and also for the cheaper rate so that more people can enjoy the comfort .
(ARA,medium) I do not agree with the idea that it is better to travel with a group led by a tour guide . However , I like to travel alone or with my own friends . And , I actually have three reasons for that . First of all , it is more enjoyable for a tourist to discover the country he/she is visiting by him/her self . the tour guide does not allow you to have the pleasure of exploring the new area you are in . Actually , that is the opposite of my advantering personality . second of all , you can not be free enough with a tour guide . whithout a tour guide , I can wake up whenever I want and I can go wherever I like at any time . However , if I am led by a tour guide I can not do that because I will have appointments and I will have to be on time for them . third of all , the only advantage a tour guide can give me is to show me the best places to visit or let me aware of the nieghborhoods in the city I am visiting . Howeve , I can complete my trip with need to this advantage . And , there is no reason besides that to have a tour guide . Based on those three reasons , I make my preference to have a trip without a tour guide .
(JPN,low) I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . There are two main reasons to support my oppinions . When people thnk about future of the car , many of they might be think about the oil problem . Actually oil price is geeting higher and higher in theses days and some analysits say that all the oil we have now will be gone next 50 years . But we can not ignore about ability of the new technology . Not only Japanse car company but also all of the world company are fascinating to creat new car which is not depend on oil enagy . Soura cars and car running by the power of Hydrogion . And aols new enagy is realized now . For example in Brazil they get the enagy from the plants . Other reason is that we are so depend on car life . Weuse car every day . We ca n't live without car . Especially United States , country is too learge so that other trnsportation is not be devepoed enough . In Jaapan people are also depend on car life . To tell the truth , legs of humans are cars . So we will never be able to say good bay to the car . I think it 's sad thing that we are so depend on car life . But I also think we can creat much better car to us and to the environment after twenty years . So that I think there will be not fewer cars in use than there are today . I think it can be increased .
(ARA,high) I agree with the statement made as it is clear that people have come to understand that there have been several attempts made to reduce global pollution . The use of vehiciles has put the world on red alert as we are destroying our atmosphere day by day with emissions of harmful gases and intoxicants . We are all aware of the amount of harm we are doing to our atmosphere because most citizens would rather go from destination A to B with their privately own cars without acknowledging what we are doing to the earth itself . Governments worldwide and national organizations have been concerned with the issue of pollution and how it is going to affect in the near future . Several organizations have acknowledged this issue and are implementing rules restricting the use of private vehicles . There are alternative ways other than using cars , which are mainly used for transportation and rarely for recrational activity . One option is that all cars , that are owned privately , are destroyed and all citizens and inhabitants of a certain area restrict themselves to public transport such as buses . This will be of great benefit to both society and the atomshere around us . First of all it would reduce our financial problems like car payment , petroleum , services and so on . Another suggestion is that the make trains , also known as metro 's to be used more often which consume electricity rather than petrol . Governments have stated that there would be a great drop in the number of cars purchased and the numbered currently owned , and not to include the rate of gas emissions would drop to around forty five percent in the coming years if people abide by this rule and follow it .
(CHI,medium) I do not agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . In my opinion , we should concentrate our limited time and energy to one specific field and become the expert in it . First and formost , it is impossible to learn knowledge of various subjects well at the same time . We human race has accumulated so much knowledge throughout history that it is even impoosible for an individual to know all the names of every subject , needless to say to master a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Even if the person is really talented at learning and can achieve this goal , he will find out that he has waste a lot of precious time which he can otherwise spend on entertainment or things which he is interested in . Secondly , it is unnecessary to understand the knowledge of some subjects which you may never has the chance to use in your lifetime . For example , if you are an mechanical engineer who specialize in auto-mobile designing , what is the point of learning how to design a nuclear bomb ? Or suppose you are a student majoring in English Literature , what can you do with the knowledge of oil detection ? The most imporant reason is that , in today 's fierce competition , one has to become special and indispensable in one field order to win the game . This requires the individual masters a skill which he can perform better than anyone else . We are living in a time when the knowledge is increasing in an unpreceding speed and there are numerous academic fields . It is well known that modern competition is increasingly based on techonology and innovation . However , it is impossible to create new knowledge or devices without mastering the current existing knowledge well and knowing the subject perfectly . Those who are superficial is likely to lose the game , although they might know a lot of knowldge with other subjects . I have to admit that it is vital for a person to master the basic knowledge of some disciplines . For instance , the knowledge of dealing with a fire emergency is necessary for everyone . But we have to find the balance between specialization and universatilzation . based on the former discuI strongly agree with the view that it is more important to specialize in one filed rather than get a broad knowledge with irrelevant fields .
(SPA,medium) In the actual society , the marketing is very used for the factories to trying to sell their products . They use famous people and they make differents actions , but when you try to make it at home , you see that it 's impossible . For example , there are lots of advertisements about products for cleaning the house . When the girl of the advise use it , she needs only few minutes to obtain an important results in their clothes , the oil of a jeans dissapear in 30 seconds or the white of a shirt return . Other example is the car whose colour change with the weather , it 's not true , but they make a nice advise and you think that it 's possible . Furthermore , this products are more expensive than other with the same characteristics only because their adverisements are more popular and because they have spent much money in them . There are persons who believe in this advertisements and when they buy it , they show that it is n't that they hoped . But , only if every person buy this product one time , the factory will be rich . For it , the factory only think that they must attract the more quantity of costumers however they buy the product only in one ocassion . In my opinion , the government should make more restrictions with this advertisements . They should study their skills and they make a ranking of the betters products . Nowadays , is very usual to see a little letters in the products where we can read that this products has passed all of the requirements and it has a very good quality .
(JPN,medium) Regarding the statement , I disagree with the statement . I believe that people should study one specific subject for their knowledge and it make your life enrich . Because you can learn a specific subject deeply that you are very interested in . Also if you have a lot of knowledge for specific subject , it will be your asset and you can be a specialist at work . First of all , you usually select a major from your interest . It indecates that you are interested in your subject basically so you can learn lots of things from the subject . So once you can enjoy to learn the subject then you can also get lots of knowledge . On the other hand , if you learn many subjects that you are not so interested in , I suppose that it could not be useful knowledge . Secondally , it would be expand your career options if you could get a lot of knowledge of specific subject . According to the recent news pepar , called Nikkei , many companies tend to hire specialsts than generalists . Because specialists already have knowledge for specific subject so a company does n't need to provide a training to them . But for generalists , they need get training when they start a job to get specific knowledge and skills . For conclusion , I would like to say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject that makes your life meanful and enrich .
(CHI,medium) I support the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I hold this believe because cars have already caused too many damage to the environment and use a lot of natural resources , hence they will be eventually superseded by other highly environmental friendly transportation tools . Let 's look at first what cars have brought with us over the decades : pollutions , trafic accidents , waste of irons and used up of oils etc . Those negative effects have already impact our life a lot . Such as people will loose their best friends or relatives during a trafic accidents . More importantly , the negative espect also impact our enrionments . We all know that the worlds becoming warmer and warmer , while one primary factor contribute to the global warming is the excessive immission of gasses used by millions of cars everyday etc . This harmed our world 's air and damaged the environment . Consider all these negative impacts , there are voices that already recommend to ban the production of cars . Further more , twenty years later , as producing more cars will turn out to be not realistic because of the tightier resource constraints , people will stop producing cars and turn to produce other transportation tools . Given the rapid technology improvement , I stronly believe that cars will be finally superseded with another more advanced transportation tools . This can be true after sentific researches and many experiments . Imgine a life that we can go anywhere via jet planes that similar like the situation just as dipicted in the fiction film . Then , our life will be totally different as what we are today . In conclusion , twenty years from now on , I belive that there will be fewer and fewer cars in use than there are as of today as a combined efforts of sentists and the publics . Lets cross our figure to wish the environment of the world , the dearest place that we live together , can be better and better after our mutual efforts for example to find other transportation tools that are more environmental friendly than cars !
(CHI,low) I disagree with the statement . Because i think that , do something we are known is more easlier to handle . Successful people have done something that he good at , and this thing make him successful . Use Disney for example . every years , they will have new cartoons to show us . Many people all over the world must watch them . Becaus Disney is good at creative cartoons . These cartoon make Disney famous , successful and wonderful . Disney also has their own Disneyland . It is a famous story that everyone knows . However , if Disney try to do something they have n't done before , such as they going to have a fashion store to selling some high fashion clothes . I think it may be not working . Becaus they are not good at creative fashion things , they ca n't use the same ways to creative fashion from creative cartoon . May be they can success at the end . But i have no idea about the date they can do it . Before they are success in the fashion ares , they must lose many time and money . People can not know about why Disney want to creative fashion . Because all people just know their cartoon is fantastic . No one will belive that they can do it at the beganning . People will have some brands of fashion to buy clothes . Becaus these brands are good at fashion . They will not try to creative cartoon . So , I think wherever sucessful people or noraml people . They just want to do their best thing of what they good at .
(GER,high) I want to state my opinion wether a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than to specialize in one subject . Both ways have their specific advantages and disadvantages which I would like to state in the following text . Having a broad knowledge is always an advantage , not only when it comes to game-shows like `` Who want 's to be a millionaire '' . Knowing a lot gives you an open view to the world as it is . It opens you for alternative explanations and solutions and might even make you into a more tolerant person . Even though from this point of view it seems very usefull to gather a broad knowledge it also brings with it some problems . Many specific knowledge is what makes you an expert in some area . When beeing a competitive person who always tries to be the best you will not achieve your goal , if you are not focussing your energy to some few subjects and even if you are not competitive the everyday job-requirements force you to have a certain amount of knowledge about a special subject . Even though the capacity of the human brain seems to be nearly unlimited , the time of most humans is not . Getting a broad knowledge needs a lot of time to gather this knowledge . If you try to get to this knowledge on a university you soon will have to face the fact , that not just the time but also the money of most persons is limited . In most countries all over the world , studying is not for free . Even in Germany where Universities where free for decades a growing number of federal countries is intoducing study fees . So at one point or another most people have to make a decision between the amount of knowledge to gather , and the time and money they got to do this . In my opinion a broad knowledge is an ideal which is very hard to reach . So I think it is better to first concentrate on one subject and to get to know everything possible about it , get a job by using that knowledge and try to broaden your horizon afterwards . Not doing so will turn you into an unemployed academic with a broad knowledge . When talking about this topic another pretty important thing has to be mentioned . More important than finding time to gather knowledge , is to make sure you do n't loose the one you once had . In Germany it is said , that when finishing Highshool one has the broadest knowledge in his whole life . When starting to study often just a few months are needed to loose this knowledge , mostly because one focusses on his primary subject in college . So maybe the mentioned ideal is easier to reach by not forgetting knowledge than by gathering it . To summarize my personal view : I for myself always try to gather as much knowledge as possible even though I know it is just possible within certain limits given by the environment . But even though it is surely better to have this broad knowledge I will never say a bad word about someone who just tries to be the best in his primary subject .
(ARA,medium) First of all i would like to approve my opinion on this statement . This is just what i would like to talk about , people who take risks and try new stuff tend to get more successful in their life , on the other hand people who tend to be close minded and only do what they know and in the same way over and over again , this would improve them at all . When people try new things they discover new information , they allow themselves to think differently , to act differently , not only would it help himself , it would also have great changes on the country . This type of behaiviour is what we call a part of leadership . When people do what they already know how to do well and keep on doing it over and over again , that would not help them at all , because they are doing the same pattern , without interacting with new features and by that they are n't learning . In case of Newton , we would n't have known today how to measure forces and gravitational fields if it was n't for his discoveries and his dessive state of mind . In other words if Newton have n't tried and experemented the stuff in different ways , he would n't have done what he did . Scientists are trying really hard these days to find a cure to canser and they are trying new stuff and things and taking risks , in order to do the best they can to get to the cure ASAP . In my point point of view i would take risks and try new things to get to the best state of knowledge i can get to . I am working so hard at the moment , trying new stuff and hoping to become a great man someday , hopefully soon . My advise to you all is to experience new things and tryout stuff u never imagined your self doing it . You never know what might be the thing that you would end up with .
(FRE,high) It is well known that education is a tricky issue . It raises a lot of questions and everybody does not agree on it . Indeed , educational differences between countries is a telling example of those questions . Specialization is prefered in some countries and others adopt a general educational pattern . From my point of view , a general broad knowledge is better than to spezialize in only one subject . I support the idea that with a real general knowledge you develop your ability to have a general view of the world . A case of point to highlight is that , yet among Ancient Greek philosophers a general knowledge was the condition of the achievement of the truth . That is a general statement in which I believe . Second , this Ancient belief of general knowledge has gone across centuries . I am convinced that it is still true . For instance , in my school , I am studying sunstainable development . Although some good actions are done without this general view , it is not enough . You have to consider all the parts of an issue before acting . If you try to develop fair trade , be sure that transports will not be to harmfull for the environment . Finally , from my point of view you can specialize after having received a general education . It is the French educational policy . Children must go at school and learn various subjects before specialize at college . In my opinion it makes children more likely to become good citizens , they have some knowledge in many subjects . For instance to vote , they are more aware of main issues . By way of conclusion , I would say that even though specialization is important and allows people to reach an accurate knowledge in one subject , a general view provided by a general knowledge is the way to avoid some big slides .
(FRE,medium) I agree with that statement . I really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Understand ideas and concepts is the key to learn everything . I do not think it is possible to learn in a concrete manner data things if we do not have previously clearly understand the real concept or idea of what you are talking about . Even if certain facts have to be known , I consider facts as secondary in the process of learning . I will demonstrate my thought in several points ; First it is very important to clearly distinguish the concept from the fact , For exemple the Economy is a concept , although the precise amount of the American economy is considered as a fact . As that exemple indicates , we can not clearly understant data things if we do not learnt previously what is the concept . The concept gives the general idea of what we are talking about . The idea or concept gives to the students the elements to understand and analyse by themselves data things . Moreover , the understanding of a concept has to be considered as an entire intellectual activity since it requires all our attention , our curiosity , and our capacity to absorb and understand informations . For these reasons , i think that data things must be used to represent and illustrate the concept and not the opposite . The facts must be used to make the understanding of an idea easie , and it is too bad that the scholar system does not often give enough importance to the understanding of concept . Finally , I believe en concepts since I think that students always keep in memory when they have understood it .
(GER,high) Although there are surely exceptions , I agree with the statement that young people in general enjoy life more than older people do . There are different reasons why I state this opinion . First young people do n't take life and their life-time so serious , they often do n't even think about it . Because of their youth they have the feeling that they have plenty of time left , so they are very free to spend it on whatever they like to . Enjoying life often means to take time for something that is not neccesary but that makes being alive more fun . Young people do not hesitate to spend time for travelling , parties , visiting friends and so on . Thus they enjoy life more than older people who often do n't seem to have spare time . This leads us to another reason why young people acutally have the possibility to enjoy life easier . As long as they go to school or study they do n't have to work the whole day like older people have to . They just have more free time to deal with and they are most likely not as tired in the evenings as older people are after having worked many hours . As a result older people will probably prefer to sleep on such evenings instead of doing something they really enjoy , although the next day will again start with working . Furthermore there is one important thing which distinguishes young people from older people . In general young people do not have so much responsibility . They often live at home where their families look after them and they must not worry about money , food , insurances and things like that . Older people who live on their own , perhaps have an own family and must earn the money to pay the living , have much more responsibility and often also worries . So enjoying life in this situation is more difficult which is perhaps a reason why many older people have problems doing it . Nevertheless I think especially as an older person who has to manage life in so many ways it should be an aim to enjoy it at the same time or at least most of the time . Onle then it is worth living .
(TEL,high) Cars , which are considered as means of necessity now a days , were considered as luxury in 1950's and 1970's . People since 1970 has increased using cars because they stand for prestige . The present topic is use of cars in twenty years , whether there will be more or few cars in use . There are both advantages as well as disadvantages of using car . Advantages could be 1 ) economical , as the whole family could travel at the same time and costs less when compared to the expenses of travelling by train or bus . 2 ) Second advatnage could be halting or taking rest when wanted . The disadvanatges could be 1 ) pollution , 2 ) increasing traffic , 3 ) more accidents . Now-a-days , people in cities like london , tend to leave their cars at home and prefer travelling by train to their destinations and this probably could be due to INCREASED TRAFFIC , which delays people from commitments . So I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use . The second point that inclines me to take the side of the statement is POLLUTION . Most of the people are suffering with respiratory diseases like asthma , chonic bronchitis and for this pollution could be blamed partly . People who lived all their lives working in bigger cities tend to retire in country side to avoid air and sound pollution . So this could be one of the reason that in future use of cars will be lowered . The third point which supports my decision regarding fewer cars in use in twenty years is obesity and physical fitness . People are more bothered about their physical fitness as they are busy with the work and ca n't exercise in leisure time . So as a matter of fact most people to improve and maintain physical fitness ride bikes to work than using cars . So to conclude , with all the above reasons there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
(HIN,high) Humans are curious by nature . We tend to know more and explore the areas which we are unsure about . Curosity in turn , causes new invention and thus improves our living style as we can see in the case of developing technology . In my opinion , risks are a part of new inventions and it helps us knowing more about the unresolved mysteries that exists like the part of neuroscience still under development . Risks open new path for developments . People working for NASA , take several risks of trying out new things which were never tried before . landing on moons , launching rockets with human beings in it to get an exact picture of space . NASA is at its peak of success and it 's much more because of its ability to try out new things . Trying out new things add adventure to life . Without taking any sort of risks life would be like a stagnant pool of water with steady results or rather no change in the usual life style . Risks are a little dangerous as the word itself might suggest but it does open up new dimensions for human to work on and explore more . Risks are not to be scared from . If taken in limited and sensible amounts , it will have more positive effects than negative . NASA does n't take a step without a scientific background to the information it works on . They calculate and prepare for the worst and achieve succesful results exploring new facts about space science . There is a well known saying called , `` No risks , no gain . '' It emphasizes on the fact that risks are a part of exploration process . Without risks there wont be much to learn new things from . Almost every job has some components that provide the employee with certain challenges to deal with , which might involve taking some risks or doing something new out of the usual practise .
(TEL,high) Yes . I agree that in the near future the number of cars that are in use will be lesser than that of today 's car count . The first reason for my agreement with the statement is that the world 's economy is growing at a faster rate and technological innovations are immanent within the system . This might result in an efficient , cost-effective , superfast railway network which connencts an urban area like a labyrinth . The main emphasis is given to urban ares in the previous statement because they are the ones that have more number of cars than the rural areas usually do . The state-of-art technology might drive the communers to use the railways as an alternative to using cars . This might lead to less number of cars in next twenty years . There is a general concern over environmental pollution especially on air pollution . The main contributor to this air pollution is the smoke produced from the exhaust of the car engines . The awareness toward this pollution might reach all the citizens of the urban areas and make them realize the importance to reduce the pollution . As a result they might seek alterantive means of transport apart from cars . Consequently this awareness might urge the citizens not to use cars in the near future . One of the major concerns in the modern society is the cost of the petroleum or gas . It is so high that people are hesitating to use cars even now . As the natural resources of the earth are limited and the use of oil consumption has been very high despite its cost , the situation in twenty years could be marked by lack of enough oil for transporation . Obvioulsy this would inhibit people from using the cars if there are no other alternative fuels for cars . In twenty years an exotic , efficient and impressive machine might be invented . As humanbeings , who always want to try out something new , would feel prestigious if they were possessed with that exotic , impressive machine . Again this might lead to decrease in number of cars in twenty years .
(ITA,medium) I do not agree with the statement because I think that , at least in the Country I live in and for the experiences I had , young people give aid to the communities in fields where the State has not enough money to do everything it 's supposed to . I 'm not that old , so I cannot tell exactly how it was in the past , but today I can tell that also if society is getting every day more individualistic and selfish , people take care of the persons in need and try to help them as much as they can . Many volunteer organizations have grown up in the city I live since I came here eight yers ago , and most of the volunteers are young : they mostly act in welfare , providing food to poor people and covers during the winter time . It 's true that it 's not the majority of the population , but I know a lot of people ( and I am one of these ) that spend part of the week trying to do something good for others in their own cities . Many people goes far in the world , like in third world countries , to help people there , but sometimes does n't realize that just in the neighborhood next to their house there is somebody who needs the same kind of help . But welfare is not the only field : volunteer organizations have born also to help the State preserving the huge cultural heritage of Italy , giving a fundamental help when an earthquake damaged the central part of the Country , preventing the loss of incredible art treasures . I think that most of the things I exposed are done by young people because most of them are still dreamers and feel better acting like this . They are usually more enthusiastic and to them it 's not enough to just give money for charity .
(TUR,high) People today are faced with a stark choice as they can not decide to use their cars or try other ways to transport . Having been a user of car for six years , I am well aware of its many drawbacks . It is very costly due to high oil prices and risky as many accidents happen . In addition to these , toxic gases from the cars pollute enviroments . Due to all these reasons , I agree that car use will decrease in next twenty years . To begin with , oil prices will get higher as the source of oil on the earth will decrease and this will make using cars much more expensive . As result of this , people will choose to walk for shorter distances or use public transport in longer distances . These options are cheaper than using car . In additon to oil prices , parking price is another factor which increases cost of using cars . As cities will get bigger , number of parking spaces will decrase which will increase their price . In this way , many people will also choose public transport to avoid paying high parking prices . Besides being costly , using cars is also risky as many people die or seriously injured in car accidents everyday . Many people think that while using cars , they are under a serious risk of having accident . The reason of the crash or the carelessness causing crash may not always stem from you but you also get injured when the other driver has a fault . This shows that there is always a certain risk in driving car . In this way , planes will be mostly preferred in future as they offer a safer alternative . Most importantly , cars pollute the environment as they release toxic wastes . These wastes cause air pollution which brings about serious lung diseases . In other words , when you use car , you cause deaths or illnesses of some people . Therefore , in next years , as people will not be able to stop production facilities which are also an important air polluter , people will try to reduce the air pollution caused by cars . In this way , people may start to use bicycles which do not pollute the environment and additionally , is benefical for their health as provides regular exercise . For example , I have many friends who started to use bicycles for both his health and the health of posterity . To sum up , in next years , less people are likely to use cars as it is costly , risky and harmful for the environment . I think that most people are likely to use bicycles as it is cheaper and do not harm the environment . In this way , they can leave the clean air to the posterity .
(CHI,medium) Although many people believe that it is better to have knowledge in a certain specific subject , I think we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . There are three reasons presented as followed . To begin with , we need to have a broad knowledge before we enter the job market . This society now are very competitive , and we do not want to fall behind others . Studying many academic subjects offers us to have more possibilities . Thus , the more we learn , the more oppotinutes we have . In addition , learning a wide range of different knowledge will fulfill our daily lives . If we only focus on one subject , we might become a professor in the field . But there are many things that we can not learned from only one subject , we will not have the ability to deal with those things . What is more , we can find something we would like to do by picking up many subjects . From learing different subjects , we can find new things in different subjects . For example , we can find what we are good at and after we graduated from school we can find a relative job . To sum up , I strongly agree that we should learn many academic subjects for several reasons , among them giving more competitive stutus , filling up our lives , and finding strange
(KOR,medium) Those who dose belive that younge people spent very much time to do for their communities . However , I might say that young people recently do not give enough time to taking care of the sociey which they belongs . There are several resons : to spent their own time for their future and to share time with peers . First of all , young people are supposed to spent their own time for their future . You might say that young people want to spent time to do something for their communities . However , you may not deny that it is critical for them to develop their ability for their future . As society is getting more complex , the required ablility to survive in the dog-eat-dog society is more complicated . Therefore , the role of young people has been changed . It was to consider other peole and their communities but now it is to concentrate for own achivement and success life in the future . Moreover , young people want to share time with peers . By being with peers , they can feel comfortable and have fun with similar interest stuff . They enable not only to coperate with friends for some project and but also to become sociable to make their own rules and roles within the peer groups . For instnace my sister does not volunteer for her communitis , however she enthusiatically worked in peer group study everyday to prepare her project in school . Then she could get `` A+ '' in the project . To sum up , I agree that young people spend most time for ouw
(CHI,medium) I agree with this statement . Successful always come from trying and taking risk . People in the world all knew that if you want to become successful , you got to try . You may learn a great experience while you are trying new things . There might have something that you were afraid of and never want to try at all . However by an accident you got to do this thing and you actually did it , this will give you encourae and you will feel very proud of yourself . This is how successful works . Those people ca n't become successful is because they do n't want to try , everythings just stay the same , always do the thing that they already know how to do well . New things always let you grow up , if people rather stay the same they wo n't grow at all . I was a very good example that rather try new things instead of do things that I already know how to do well . When I was young , I do n't know how to ride bicycle , and i was afraid of it . However i keep telling myself that `` if you wo n't try , you will never knew how to ride a bicycle . '' And at first it was very horrible , i always fall down and get hurts . Although i was not very good , i still try the new thing and I knew that i could become better and better . Because of this thought and persverience , in the end I know how to ride a bicycle . Form my example we can see the different between try new things and stay the same . We always afraid new things taht we did not know about it . But think about it , if you try the new things you will learn a new experience and you might like it after you try , so do n't just stay the same , try new things .
(SPA,medium) Ideas and concepts are based on assumptions and historical moments , however facts are real and most of the time scientificly prouved . I believe that to understant a fact you need to understant ideas an concepts that take you to that fact . For example , in politics it is important to understant ideas and concepts of the diferents parties to understant their way of doing things . The main idea of communisum is to share everything and have the same level of life with the same opportunities . However , communist gouverment such as Cuba show that there is not a equal situation and in fact the goverment manage everyting and people are not free to do whatever ther want . The Cubain communisum show that there is a different between the concept and the fact . It think it is important to learn the concept and illustrated with real facts allows student to havea better understanding of the situation . Furthermore , ideas and concepts are the base of a fact , that is why it is a logical process for students to learn ideas and concepts to be able to understant facts . For example the monarchy in Spain , people respect the monarchy system because they understant the concept which make part of their identity . They know the background of the country and they the fact that they made part of the country history . But to understant that , you need to know the background of the country and to know what is the concept of the monarchies in other to be able to understand their position toward the spanish people .
(FRE,medium) I totally agree with this statement . Indeed it is clear advertisers want to give a good image of their products and in advertisements the product seems better then in reality . In my opinion it is not amazing because the goals of the adverts is to sell . That is why customers can only see the best aspect of the product . Advertisers have to imagine a way to lure people . If it is a good advert , people will have lust to buy the product even if they are not very well informed . I think if products seem better it is because there is a lack of information for the consumer . Besides it is not the aim of the advert to inform customers and sometimes advertisers overstep the bounds of the product by showing some irreal situation . I mean sometimes the product is not the core of the advert but the goal is to show it and that people regognize it in shops . For example a famous advert for a shampoing conveys the idea that the product is pretty erotic ... It is a weird way to use this product but if you are naive you can think it is true and you will be disappointed . Thus products are more attractive if they are not ordinary and when people see the advert on TV it is always with handsome men or pretty girls ... in order to sell dreams . As a result the product seems always better when it is on TV . For instance a woman can see a beautiful skirt on a top model but when she will see it in a shop she will be disappointed . Owing to the goal of the advert , the product is shown as something beautiful and even if it is an usual product , like soap or milk , many people will buy this one because they have seen it on TV although the product is not more different than another one . To conclude I really agree witj this statement because I think advertisements sell dreams and it is not often the reality , that is why products seem much better then they really are .
(FRE,high) We are , indeed , surrounded by cars . Over the years , driving became men 's favourite way to travel . So why would that trend come to an end in twenty years ? Costs ? Progress ? Travelling by car has a major advantage ; You choose where you will go , when you will stop . You choose your path and aim straight at your destination . You are not a passive passenger , and you are therefore less bored . Cars are also part of our culture ; Little boys play with plastic ferraries , and in some countries , such as America , so wide that public transports are less efficient than is other european cities , a car in related to freedom and independancy . But the price of fuel has gone up , as natural resources diminish , and it is accurate to think this rise will only increase as time goes by . People and governments , well aware of the situation , start planning their futures without Cars . People also seem more and more concerned with environmental issues . It is well known that cars pollute alot , releasing carbon dioxide in the air . We need our planet , and some of us are starting to realise everyone can make a difference . Moreover , other transport means are nowadays faster , cheaper , cleaner than before . Buses and subways in big cities help us avoid trafic . Planes are now easy to access . Trains are silent , direct , and clean . Whithin twenty years , progress might allows us to leave our cars to the garage . Yet it is a tought goal to achieve as , like i said , cars are part of our daily culture . And men are attached to traditions . Would your picture James Bond without his car ? Young boys think it might help them in seducing girls . Adults forgot how to live without a car . The car Industry is still creating new attractive engines . We , indeed have a long way to go , and there is no assurance that the number of cars will significativly go down by the time we reach 2026 .
(HIN,high) Though I agrees with the notion that specializing on a specific subject have more potential for contribution to knowledge as a whole , but I also thinks that confining to a specific line of discipline may leads to missing of understanding of how everything fits together . There are other points which leads to my standpoint . We live in an information age in which we have access to a sea of data . Furthermore , each subject area in itself has lots of academic literature about the knowlege accumulated throughout the ages in it . Only ff a person confine to a specialzed field and narrow down the point of focus , innovative research is possible . It may appear that in an attempt to gain wider knowledge , the student can just study what is available without getting any chance to contribute to it . Though this is true , we should not miss the point that by understanding the context and knowing how things work together can only takes one to a position that can lead him to actually contribute to the field . Historically , many of our researcher have contributed to a large variety of scientific discipline and proving the fact that knowing all peices together gives a unique perspective and hence innovation . Like thomas edison , leonardo da Vinci , Nicholas Tesla are all prolific researcher contributing to all scientific discipline . I also believe that some scientific discipline like Medicine , only being specialist can provide proper skill to perform well . We trust only specialist when it comes to medical treatment . Why we go to eye specialist when we have an eye problem rather than a general physician . The reason being that our body part are so complex that it requires a focussed pursuit of specialized knowledge to understand it . But this does not strongly supports specialist because it is the general physician who also hold vital position in giving initial treatment and direct or recommend physician only in case it crosses it 's limit . Here we see again that general physician 's varied knowledge allow him to better understand and diagonise the problem initially . So in the society we live in today both speacialist ; who pusue specialisation in subject , and Generalist ; who have broader knowledge of subject , are important . Giving importance to any one will be unjustified ; if not problematic .
(KOR,medium) In the 21 century we are facing the energy , environmental pollution and overpolulation problems . However , the cars has been kept producing everyday . as the population grows the demand on cars will increase . In 20 years from now on , there will be more cars than now on the based of following three reaons . First , the lack of energy will never stop producing cars because the new type of energy are now being invented . For example , the hybornate dioxgen cars are already commercialized in some developed countries . other than dioxgen , new source of enegy is now on the process of development . Thus , ultimate consumption of gas will not hinder the producing the cars . Second , the lack of space for transportation will be solved through developing new method of route . In the future , the cars will use sky as its main stream of transportation . We have seen flying cars in the sky way in many future movies such as back the future . The cars may use the underground as its major transportation routye in the future , Third , the demand of cars are increasing now . Before 20 years ago not all the people in the world could own his or cars . Since peiople in undeveloped countries had not enough money to purchase the car , they could not own their cars . However , the some of the undeveloped countries such as China are growing its economy , its people demand the cars . In conclusion , the lack of energy and space will never be hinderance of usage of cars . Meanwhile , the economic developments of some countries will increase its demands on cars .
(FRE,high) In my opinion , I agree with this statement because if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you are expected to work in many sectors if we take the view from a working aspect . You are also able to turn into another sector for any reason with out the need of a long and costly formation about your new work . From another aspect , I think that a person with a global knowledge is more interesting than a person how only has knowledge about a specific subject . In fact , with a person who has a global knowledge you can talk about everything and you are sure to learn something and that is person will have a point of view about everything . In the other hand , the other person would be more boring and not so interesting becquse she only knows a specific subject so after at while talking about this subject , you will feel a bite boring . But having knoweldge about a very specific subject can also be very positive . Indeed , in the business sector , we can see that industries that are specialized in only one sector are usually more efficiant than others campany which try to extend theirselves to several market with products that are complitly differents between them . Indeed , the specialized companies know very well their product and also every thing that it is around the productt : production , custumers , market , competition ... so they are very good in what they do whereas a company who extend too much will be in the end good in nothing . As a conclusion I think that you must always find a balance between beeing general and specific in every t
(CHI,high) I think people usually buy products because of attractive advertisement . But most products are worse than sample on the advertisement . Therefore , I agree with the topic -- most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . First of all , salers always tell customers how great the products are . They can make a magic story to show how products work . For example , one time I went to a cusmetic store , and the clerk told me their product was good , it could make my skin better . After I used it for a week , I did n't think so . It was not useful , and it was very expensive . I was really angry about that . Second , advertisement companies know how to design the product and advertisement to attract people . In addition , they know how to persude the customers and make many programs , such as buy one get one , or coupons . For instance , those programs usually attract women and teenagers . But they always regret after they bought those products . Third , advertisement companies usually make a survey to understand what kind of products will be popular . And they try to make a perfect product in a reasonable price on the advertisement . When customers see the advertisement , or hear from their friends or co-workers , they will rush to buy without thinking . In my opinion , I usually think twice before I buy something . It is necessary to consider about that . As I have many experiences , I do n't want to waste money on those unuseful things anymore . Now , if I really want to buy something , I always ask my friends or look up information on the internet . Salers just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantages of their products , and after you bought it , you will find out how terrible it is . Therefore , I support the idea -- most products seem better on the advertisement than they really are .
(CHI,medium) To understand the ideas and concepts and be able to utilize them is more important for students . Once the ideas and concepts are clear to the students , they can easily relate those ideas or concepts to their own life experiences . I agree with the statement because this is how I learn in the high school . A good example can be seemed while my Physics teacher is teaching us the concepts of volecity and factors . In order to make us understand that volecity is composed of different factors in different directions , the teacher gives an example of swimming in a river . As most of the students has experienced or known that when there is a current in the river and the swimmer is swimming right across the river , he will not actually go straight across the river because the current is carrying him downstrean as he swims forward . This really makes a lot of sense to all of us before we start learning any formulas . However , if the teacher just want students to learn the fact that the swimmer will go across the river adjusent to where he sets off by illustrating with a right triangle , I will probably be the first one to be confused . With the same source in my Math class , this idea comes to me when my teacher tells us a story of his own . My math teacher used to be a straight-A student in the high school , and he did not care much about understanding the concepts of the course materials . Instead , he solved the problems with formulas like a machine that does not know what exactly
(ITA,medium) I deeply agree with the staments reported . Marketing is a fundamental activity for firms , I would say , a very profitable business in which every year millions , if not billions of dollars are invested and the fact that advertisements in general are exploited to show products and product 's features different from the real way they are really , does not surprise me , even it would maybe surprise many other goods consumers . We are used to see almost everyday very colorful and energic advertisemets through so many business channels , like televisions , newspapers or radios for instance , and we often believe that everything that we buy really makes the difference or is totally useful in our life . Of course I 'm not saying that people should all undertake a pessimistic behaviour and think that everything in terms or products is bad , but they should probably increase their critical point of view , especially when having to purchase a certain good , point of view which could be received with a good education . Managers just exploit this lack of criticism , as I would describe it , and , as anticipated before , invest great amounts of money in showing their products off in the society as beautiful and colorful as possible , through marketing . Consumers are then invited to buy , so attracted by the media , they go to a store and buy everything they were just so eager to have , and , after a couple of days they have bought something , their interest for what they have bought begins to fall , until it gets replaced by a new product which firms 's manager have meanwhile developed . This takes place of course for all of the most typical types of products , for the most expensive ones as for the other cheaper goods of mass consumption . According to me , this behaviour will not stop , being us as humans so easily affectable and in our pretty predictable nature .
(FRE,high) Since the creation of cars , the number of cars constantly grew notably in the advanced and developed countries such as Great Britain , United-States of America , France and so on . We will see why there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today . First of all , the costs of cars decrease that means more people are able to purchase a car . It is possible thanks to the competition between car industries , there are greater competition now than before and I expect that will be the sams thing in the future through the globalization and the outsourcing in poor countries or in developing countries which decrease the price of cars > Secondly , in our days , the cars facilitate the life . Cars are part of our life because cars are very efficient . In order words , for example , I have a car and I can go everywhere that I want , I have not the constraints of waiting the public tranportation , to see at what time the transport vehicules will come . Moreover , when I go to the supermarket and I buy a lot of water , it is far better to use your car rather than the public transportation . Thirdly , with cars , you can see and visit your family more frequently than before . Because cars go fast the distance between you and your families , friends or people you want to see is shorter . To pocess a car is like a liberty of moving , you can do whatever you want in term of tranportation . To conclude , cars are a important tools of our life , you can use it for a lot of reason such as for going to work , to go to see people , to go to buy something while the public transportation is time over , you can use it to put things that you cannot take if you have not car like a big television . In addition , you can go to travel with your familly , somtimes it is cheaper to use your cars than to take the airplane or train . For all those reasons , social and economical , there will have more cars in 20 years . With the emergence of developing countries such as China , Brazil , there will be even more cars .
(KOR,high) Recently , it is more common to have a tour guide while travelling than going a trip without a tour guide . While some people like to have a tour guide to see many attractive sites , in my opinion it is not the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide because of it has lots of restrictions . First of all , people travelling with a group led by a tour guide have a time constraint while travelling . Suppose you want to spend more time in a museum than in anywhere else , but you are given only 20 minutes to stay in the museum . How possible is it for you to stay when the bus leaves after that ? If you have the flexibility of your time , you would not have to encounter this kind of problem . Second of all , travelling with a tour guide with a lot of people will more likely give less personal experiences . I would like to give my experience as an example . Last summer I went to a trip to the Rocky mountains in British Columbia Canada with around 30 other people and a tour guide . We went to so many places in such a short time so that I could not remember where I went . When I was checking the photographs that I have taken , I could not say any difference about the lakes and mountains that I have went . Even though I have seen only lakes and mountains for the whole three days , I could not remember one of them in special , because we had spent only short amount of time on each place so that I did not have any special memory or a feeling in one site . To conclude , I would rather travel with my few close people without a tour guide than having lots of restrictions while traveling . A famous poet said , ' Travel to discover yourself . ' I would rather have more time for myself in one site while travelling than visiting many spaces without any specail memory .
(ARA,medium) I really agrea with the point that says most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . In fact tey have to do that to attract the customers . As a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not . As i said most of the time the usually products looks much better than the are . Every comany or shop does that . It is just part of their business . The more they sell means the more they are successfull in their work , and in their business . These kind of adertisements became normal and common in these days , even though there are a few copanies say the right things about their products as they seem . Anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for us . As we know each comany has its own plan to attract the customer . In these days they even try to call you , and introduse their items to you . You would see alot of advertisements on internet , in newspapers , in magazines . Sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free . That thing happened to me , when i was going to buy a cell phone , which has a sticker on it says free . I was suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly as you like . We see strange things that has to do with markting , because everyone wants to be the best . Since that they try to do anything to show their items as they want . In my openion they have the right to make products seems much better than the really are .
(HIN,medium) `` aim for the sky , and you will reach the mountain top '' this is a famous saying which in my knowledge , is indeed practiced by a number of successful people . In order to be successful , it is mandatory for one to try the impossible , try new things and take risks . only this attempt can direct you closer to your goal . Buccess is a relative term . i percieve success to be my goal , my aim in life . the road to success is a never-ending one , much longer than you expect it to be . There are numerous obstacle through your way to achieve your goal . Being succussful is one of the biggest challenge in life . and maintaining your success is another . Every succussful person has taken unpredictable , steps which either turns out to be a disaster , or the biggest success of his career . this step is immensely risk-prone . For example , let there be a company in which there are two individuals working in the same level of priority , Mr.X and Mr.Y. they both work on similar subjects using the same method , and finish it in the same time frame . if Mr.X wishes to succeed and reach the post of the highest priority in the company , he is required to try something new . take a few risks , and work on the subject with a different approach . this approach can turn out to be a complete waste , or he might have just discovered a faster method of execution . in this process he also gained knowledge . having a broader knowledge , helps you achieve success much faster and easily . only by trying new things , can you stretch your capacity to excel . you can never be successful if you feel complete . if you conclude your knowledge to be the saturation point . there is a saying `` try , try , till you succeed '' . this is the best prescribed method you can use to reach your goal . every step , be it a successful or disastrous , makes you learn something. a bad one is just another hurdle in your race to success . it makes you think methods to overcome it . ideas to navigate your way past it . these hurdles are pure sources of knowledge .
(KOR,medium) I strongly agree that successful people try new things and risks than only doing what they already know how to do well . First , I have seen successful many people so far in my field which is civil engineering . Most of them are professors or reseachers . They only studied their detail major during master and Ph . D course so they could be specialist in their field . However , after being specialist , they do to research about another detail field because they feel that they ca n't survival if they do only reseach their own field . For example , my academic advisor professor Cho , who was studying Traffic engineering in the Ph . D course , is famous professor regarding concrete pavement in Korea . He did n't know well about concrete pavement . The reason why he did reseach on concrete pavement is that he finds out the relationship between the traffic volum and the feature of materials of the pavement . Now he is the best specialist because he has been trying new things . On the other hand , some professors or researcher intent to easy go . They only research about their detail field so they ca n't develop and success . I think , all those thing considered , people continusely try to develop new things for success .
(TEL,high) The issue under consideration is the argument that most advertisements attempt to project their products in a manner that showcase the products in much better light than they actually are . This issue appears to be a very common and valid statement , since more often than not , it is a general complaint among customers that products never seem to deliver what they promise in their promotions . However , I would like to disagree with this statement , keeping in mind my consideration of certain important factors , such as the process that people use to choose certain products , the efforts being made my manufacturers towards developing their products , government , civic and judicial laws that mandate advertisements to give the correct picture , and the role of public interest groups that strive to increase customer awareness regarding the buying of products . The first point that I would like to highlight is the motivation of customers in buying products . Many customers do not realize that the products they buy are actually not targetted at them at all in the first place . For example , people who face hair loss on their scalp tend to buy products like hair loss prevention shampoos , without first checking whether that shampoo is indeed formulated for their problem , which may be occuring due to more serious medical reasons . When such customers do not get the results they expected , they tend to blame the product , and accuse its advertisement of false campaigning . To prevent this , customers should become aware of the fact that they need to excercise discretion and perhaps get some medical or non-medical advice ( like in the shampoo 's case ) when choosing products . The next point I would like to emphasize on is the sincere efforts being made manufacturers of products to provide more information on the intended targets of products , product composition , possible shortcomings or side effects of their products , etc , through easily accessible mass communication channels like the internet and television . For example , companies issuing public mutual funds do make it a point to issue a warning at the end of their promotion on television , asking viewers to exercise caution and prior research when investing in their funds . A third very important point to note is the role of government and/or judicial bodies or authorities in passing laws that ensure that advertisements do not make false claims , and allow customers to file suits as applicable , against such companies . I believe that such laws deter advertisers from hyping up their product . Finally , any free society has a large number of public interest groups that volunteer to monitor and check wrongful acts such as over-promotion of goods or services in the intent of gaining profit by misguiding customers . Such societies provide a framework to actively patrol and educate people about such misleading ventures . In conclusion , I believe , that due to a host of factors , some of which I have detailed above , advertisements of today , though capable , do not actually make deliberate attempts to mislead customers by over-hyping the features of their products . True , they may use popular celebrities to endorse their brands , or use jazzy visuals and other media , but the actual claims made are largely truthful , and they do make sincere attempts to clarify who their target audience is .
(ITA,high) As a student , i agree totally to this statement . It is more important to understand ideas rather then memorising the facts because the final results of the two methods are totaslly different . When you just memorize a text , a formula , or a date , it is very rare that a few weeks or months later you will remember it at all . This method can be useful only for tests or oral exams , but totally useless if you want to remember that information for a long period of time . Instead , when you understand an idea or concept , and then you study it , the result is totally different , because that notion will become part of you , part of your cultural baggage that will accompany for your entire life . Although this can look obvious for most of the people , many still do n't understand it . This can be a problem if the person mentioned is somedy that is in tight contact with a student , like a teacher . I can say this thanks to my personal experience : as a student infact , i 'm in contact with a person that is the perfect example of what I 'm talking about , my math teacher . Although she is an experienced teacher , she still is of the idea that students do n't need to understand totally what the exercise is about , and thinks that it is possible to do things just by memorising formulas , without knowing why those formulas are like that and why we must use them . The result is that during the year people can do things correctly , but the following year , nobody can remember anything . So i personally think that just memorising something ca n't help a student , if not for his or hers immidiate future . But the problem arrives when the student needs the notions he has learned during high school to be able to get into university and to understand things once he is in . In conclusion , if you understand an idea , it is right for you to explain it to somebody else , especially if it is the teacher that was n't able to explain it to you in the first place .
(TEL,medium) I would like to agree with the statement that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . The reason for my agreement with the topic is there are plenty of advantages when there is a guide when we travel in a group . The major problems which we face when we are moving in a group is that defenitely the group includes people of different behaviours , the time punctualities and there will be no coherence between the people , If we are led by a guide defenitely everyone in the group listens to him and follows him as he is leading them . Another advantage is that the guide will be familiar with the places we visit and so we need not waste our time on finding the ways to that place and we do n't miss the places which are of greater importance . Some people may think that hiring a guide will increase the cost of their trip , i think it is not true infact we will save alot of money we can ask the guide to take to the motels which we can afford and there would n't be a chance to e defrauded since peple tries to cheat the tourists who are not native to that place likewise we can even save our valuable money and can use for another purpose .. Guides also shows the important places of that area as we may not be familiar with them . For instance , when we planned a trip to canada on last summer we are familiar with the places over there we got only one week to visit all the places and we got plans to victoria and vancouver , as we know thay are located nearby but some of my friends does n't liked to lead our group by a guide they think that they will loose privacy but they did n't realized that we are lack of time and they decided to go seperately and we do n't want waste our time as the semester begins after the weekend , decide to hire a guide and we successfully completed our trip within time visiting all the tourist places over there , unfortunately our friends who went to the trip without a guide failed to return back intime , afterwards they appreciated our opinion . Hence i would rather suggest a group to be led by a guide on visting an unfamiliar place , which would save money , time and provides us with the facility to enjoy the trip with more ecstacy .
(KOR,medium) Many scientist are thinking of the earth future and they are imagining many new things that human can have . Nowadays cars are having important job for human , but there are a new thoughts that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . In opinion , I disagree with the following statement . There are three reasons that proves my idea . First reason , cars will develop more because of clever inventors and later cars can be drived on the sky . Second reason is that cars can drived without gas or oil therefore many people can just drive without thinking of costing gas or oil . The first reason is that the cars will more develop by many clever inventors , therefore people can drive the cars on the highway and also on the sky . Yesterda , I watched a document about our future and it was explaining the mystery of movies of future . For example , in the movie Starwars the cars are flying and the sky is full of cars . The professor was answering about this movie and he said that it is 70 percent possible , that car can fly . Therefore when cars can fly people will more buy the cars to have fast transportation . The second reason is that cars can moved withour gas or oil . Nowadays many poor people does n't buy cars , because of costs . But last week , the world news war reporting that the cost of oil and gas is increasing all the time . That 's why a car making company is trying to make cars that they does n't need oil or gas . They started to make this car for five years and they expect that it will take more about ten years . The experiment of new making cars are going very successfully and the reporter said we can expect the future of our cars with oil or gas . As a conclusion , in twenty years there will be more cars not fewer cars in use than there are today . These three reasons are proving why this statement is incorrect . First reason is that the car can fly therefore the cars will have more space to drive and many people will buy cars to have faster transportation . Second reason is that cars will not need to fill gas or oil to drive . The cost of gas and oil are troubling people 's money therefore a car company is trying to make car with out these things and it is running pretty successful . In the future , human can use cars much in easier way .
(TUR,high) Specialization or Broad Knowledge Whether or not specialization should be favored in academics is a controversial issue . It is not easy to completely state that specialization on a specific subject is better compared to having broad knowledge of academic subjects . However , I belive that specialization on a specific subject should be accompanied with a broad knowledge of other subjects . Firstly , it is practically not possible and reasonable to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Human time and energy would not be sufficient to have knowledge on many issues . Even though it is ideal , specialization in a subject is only possible for mankind . To have a broad knowledge on academic subjects is not reasonably possible , since it is contrary to the idea of academics . Furthermore , specialization would help for the evolution of human civilization . Progress could only be achieved by knowledge and only by specilization such a knowledge could be achieved . Knowledge is attained through concentration , research and experimentation . However it is not possible to experiment in all realted academic subject . For instance , if Newton did not contentrate on physics but have bits and pieces of physics , biology and chemistry he wouldnot be able to develop his theories . Similarly , if Freud did not specialize on psychoanalysis many of his assertions would not exist . On the contrary , it must be kept in mind that an academics require an awareness . In order to be a serious academic , apart from specialization general knowledge and awareness is required . An academic in social sciences should be open to learning about chemistry for instance . Specialization only has a value if is exercised within the context of relevant disciplines . For instance , a commercial lawyer , must know the codes , doctrine as well as the relevant history , economic structure , managerial problems , business practice . Consequently , in the 21st century it is required for humans to be specialized . The primary reason for specialization is the progress of mankind . In addition to that , one most always keep in mind that a specialist always have to have broad knowledge
(FRE,medium) Advertisements are everywhere . You can see in the street , watch it on television , heard it on the radio . It is almost impossible to live without it . The purpose of advertisements is to make the future customer buy the company 's product . In order to make the product look good , advertisements can be very tricky . There are some reasons what make me think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . In my opinion , the man or the woman who works in an advertisement company has to have a very well developped imagination . For example , if you have to make an advertisement for water , it is very difficult to figure out what to put on it . Moreover , you have to explain why your water is better than the other water on the ` water market ' . So you say that your water is healthier or has a better taste . People who make this type of commercial lie on the specificities of the water , they make products seem much better than they really are . Moreover , they want to make benefits , so they have to make you buy the product . Sometimes a comgany creates a product that you do n't even need . They make a new product , it looks useless but the commercial is so nice and well done that people want to buy absolutly the product . Advertisements lie and the efficient part of the product , they make it usefull but it is not . In conclusion , the world of advertisements is very tricky . It is very easy to fall into the trap of the ` new product ' . Advertisers are very good to make you want the product even if you do n't need it . I think that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are because advertisements companies wo n't show up the bad side of their products . So they make their product look perfect and they fool the customer .
(HIN,high) I would agree with the statement that it is necessary for students to unsersatand the basic ideas than merely learning the facts . To exemplify , lets take how an engine works . We may learn many facts about the engine as such or how curiously it works and more . But knowing the facts about the engine doesnt mean that you are conceptualising the basic idea of its mechanism . Knowing all the facts doesnot mean that you may be able to repair an engine if it broke down on way . But understading the mechanism and conceptualising how the engine works would help you a lot . Just learning facts is only a way of mugging up things . Facts always remain as facts and it doesnt mean that students are understanding it . It may teach you right from wrong ones . But if you try to understand the basic ideas you may be able to build your own answers for many questions . Students would find this atmost handy while appearing for practical exams . A student who has understood the concept will develop his own answer from a question even if he is asked an indirect or related question . Thus you are trying to find out your answer from your own knowledge base which you have conceptualised better rather than merely knowing the fact . But the students may find it difficult to conceptualise things as it is not easy for all to grab things in the same manner . For this , it is better to be more pragmatic than reading through books . It would be better for the students to picturise the mechanism and do it practically . To quote another example , it is a fact that aeroplanes fly with the help of pressure differences on its wings . But merely knowing this fact is not sufficient enough . If you try to understand the idea that an increased velocity of airflow through its wings will create lesser pressure on the surface which gets pushed upwards by the increased pressure at the bottom part , you would conceptualize the idea much faster . If somenoe can show this with a model or a picture , the students woul understand it better . Students who have poor ideas or concepts finds themself difficult to get updated with latest innovations and techniques about those subjects . So understanding the ideas and concepts holds the key for effective learning and success .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . There are three main reasons of that . First of all , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects increase your potentials . For example , even if you have not decide what to do as a career in the future , you can choose any career . In addition , if you decide what to do , companies will require various knowledge . A person who has broad knowleds has more ability to work for various sections than a person who has only one specific subject . Finally , if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you will get a good position in the company . A person who has a good position have to manage various situation . When he manage various situation , he is needed to have various points of view . Boad knowlede of many academic subject can help to have various points of view . For these three main reasons , it is sure that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject .
(HIN,high) I m line wid the idea that young people enjoy their life more then their elders do . Young people beleive that only a healthy mind can dwell in healthy body . Youths have revolutionised the world of entertainment and serves to be the backbone of entertainment industry . Young people are very energetic and enthusiastic . They do every thing , they undertake , with extra vigour and keen intrest . Undoubtedly their physical state plays a major role in making them appropriate to enjoy life to its fullest . while ours elders lacks that zeal and enthusuasm beacause of their dotage and senility . Jack , a graduate student from harvard university , has variety of hobbies ranging from taking part into adventorous river rafting , enrolling for mountain tracking to horese riding . Playing football is his strength and chess being his meditation . He also does yogic exercises while in gymnasium . Moreover indulging himself in sports helps to stay him fit , active and alert . And this thing had helped him substantially to achieve a sense of contentment at all the three fronts of his life , be it professional , personal or social . Youths beleive that Enjoying life could recede stress and pressure from their life . So they go to theatres to watch a latest movie , play various musical instruments , surf the internet to gather the information about latest happenings around the world , go for paraglyding , take part in adventurous sports and many more other sports and medium of entertainment that our elders could not even think of . It has been seen that a boy would be very excited and cheerful about his new bike and would take pleasure in admiring the beauty and latest technology , the bike has . On the contrary our elders are burdened because of their social and professional committments . They do not have enough time for relishing and savoring their lifestyle . So they may not enjoy goimg to a movie or a horse riding . They would prefer to live rather a calm an serene life without excitement .
(ARA,medium) since the begining of life , poeple stood shoulder to shoulder in order to obtain and secure the primitive sources to survive . With thie time changes and eras follow years , the demand of helping and building up communities increased dramaticly . its not only helping to survive and getting food any more , its about being an active member to afford lexurity of life and improve a life style not only for the indivisual , but for the society as well . Young people who obtain the right education and got rasied upon to certain manners are always awared for the fact that they have to contribute into the society in a potant way . They know that they have to give as thay have been given other wise the circle would not keep on going on . It is not hidden that the challenges in life are increasing more than before . It is also well known that with the high level of competetion the demand for more engagments is becoming a most on order to compete and survive . With this mad rush for being thursty for the autherity and the confusion politics create , time is becomine more valuable . Time factor is being an issue . Regardless of the fact that an indivisual wants to help or not , its still obveious having the time to do so is not as easy . A young indivisual does have alot of responsibilities and duties to do now . He has to attend an educational program , a job to perfom along with many other social bonds of which he has to fulfill . I believe those engagments youth are doing are part of helping the community . Without an adequate education a guy would n't be able to obtain a good job . Without those factors he would n't be able to start a good family with healthy well mannered kids . A guy who does n't attend family gatherings is totaly being out from the basic social life of which would affect him psychologicly and it would affect his over all performance . finally , I believe everyone is helping in his own way . We just have to make sure we are helping right .
(ITA,low) The problem is if it is better to have a generic academic preparation or to have a specialization in one specific subject . I am not so agree with this statement and now I will try to explane why . The advantage to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is that you know `` something of all '' , you can spend it in many sectors of the `` world of work '' and you can do well wherever you want . But on the other hand , you know something of all but you know it less than a person that have a specific preparation in that , so for an ipotetic work a specialized person will be prefered instead of a person with a generic preparation . Instead a person with a specialization have some problems if he find a work that he does not know well , he can be confused on what to do . On the other hand the advantage to have a specific preparation is to do well what we kn Finally in my opinion we shoud have a basic knowledge , a basic preparation on many academic subject , and then we shoud have a specific area of knowledge to spend better on the `` world of work '' .
(HIN,high) I certainly agree that travelling in a group with a tour guide is the best option . Travelling outside of the place where you live is one of the most exiting and enjoyable things to do in most peoples lives . People tend to take vacations to get away from the rigours of daily life . Most people would certainly like to go alone or with an individual family if the choice existed . However most places that people consider are far away and exotic in nature , not to ignore the fact that they could be dangerous too . Take for example the Bali in Indonesia . The recent terrorist strike in Bali killed a lot of people , mostly vacationeers . Going in a group offers a lot of benifits to a traveller . Most airlines and hotels offer group booking discounts as well as preferential service . Travelling in a group also makes you feel secure rather than travelling alone . Travelling in groups would be specially advantageous to people with kids as I believe kids are better behaved and more entertained when they are in a group . Going in a group with a tour guide would also help people with disabilities . Also , why do something when you can have someone do it for you ? This is the type of question most people would ask when going out on a trip . Instead of spending time and researching about a particular destination , it would be better to employ a local expert ( tour guide ) to guide you to the right places and explain the history and culture of that particular place . A tour guide would also be helpful incase there is an emergency and you might need to contact the local authorities or need any kind of help . Also with their experience most tour guides are able to guide us to the right spots and destinations , making the most of our vacation .
(JPN,medium) After people get something beautiful , we start to feel that we want it more . If we have to take a risk , we might take that risk and try to get it because we can get even more beautiful thing . However , does everybody follow their feeling ? Specially in the business ? I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and if they should take the risks , they will take it . Firstly the reason why I think is because , there are possibilities for successful people to success even more . What is the risk for them is It is not hundred percent of posibillities , I believe . Secondly it is possible that they want to do new things about their business and try their luck . For example , we bet the money in casino and won lots of money luckly , what will we do ? Some people , do not spend on betting anymore and leave the casino or some people believe that they have strong luck that day and will keep spending on it . On the other hand , in the casino , we can not keep winning as a similar to business and this topic . In my opinion , people sometime should not take the risk , stay where they are , decide carefully and think with reality . To not follow their feeling , might cause more success in their business . Successful people more likely to take the risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Without risk , it is difficult to become successful and get what we want . However , it is not the only answer for everything . I believe we should take the risk when we should . On the other hand when we should stop and stay where we are , we should stop and stay such as losing our money in casino .
(SPA,high) I agree with the statement because I think that if you only do what you know and even if you are very good at it you will not learn anything new from it . And I think that to take risks it might not be successful everytime but its a new way to learn . If you risk and is not successful you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistakes and how to not ever make them again . So I look at taking risks as a way of learning somthing new . If you do n't risk your live will never change and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situation of taking risks you probably would do n't know what to do , or what to say , or how to react . Taking a chance to do somthing with your live like liveing in a different country , with a different language , different culture , and a lot of different situations , its to take risk because you dont know how people will act , or you do n't know peoples costumes , or even if you do n't know the language . But with time and a possitive actitude you will eventually learn about it . I belive that opportunity is taking risks and opportunity does n't come very often so I think even if you do n't end up been successful after it , I 'm sure you would learn something from it . I took the opportunity of liveing in another country than were I was born . And i did n't really know where I was going and how was it going to be . But with the time I have learned a new language and new culture , a different way to look at the world preaty much . So I think that I 'm preaty lucky because not a lot of people has done what I have , but I the same time I took a risk and i did n't know if it was going to be succesfull for me . That risk I took it 's made me enrich my person .
(JPN,high) I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Surely it is useful and nesessary to have knowlege of ideas or concepts when a student claims hisor her ideas . However , I do not think studying and understanding them is more important to learn facts . I am from Japan . I studied the socil democracy and neo liberal in Japan . Then I believed Japan need to adapt the policy of socil democracy like many European countries because recently the employment in Japan have been unstable although Japanese MNCs have increased thier sales and government has decreased the cooporation tax . So I believed the walfare system in Europe is better than American small government and strong capitalism . So I came to Europe to study the politics in Europe . However , in Europe I found what I studied in Japan about European society , philosophy and the principle of politics is different from the reality in the society . In the theory each person has same right under the law but one day I saw the situtations where two black men were rejected by the shop to enter in UK . Thier behaviors were not problem at all . In Europe I found that if the government try to protect the people 's lives , people are not independent about thier lives . Also people become intolarent to foreigners . The society do not tend to give the oppotunity to foreigners because the government or worker unions give much regulations about employments to the companies so that the rate of umemployment in many European countries are higher than the United States or Japan . So there is less chance for me . Besides , I lost many desires to work or study in Europe because many people are so easy going about life because thier lives are protected by the government . In addition , at the this christmas vacation , I visited NY . Then I felt absolutoly comfortable . Because Americans whom I talked with are more used to the different culture so that I could feel I am just one of people . Also the society inspired me to work in the United States . It was so schocking experience for me because when I had studied political philosophy in Japan , I believed that the social democacy is necessary for Japan . However , to be honest I feel so uncomfortable in Europe by the facts that I found or experiences that I have learned in Europe . So in conclution , I strongly disagree with the idea that understanding the concepts or ideas is important than learing the facts . I should have studied in the United States not in Europe .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . There are two reasons : busyness and lifestyle . The first reason why young people do n't use much time to their communities is thier busyness . Recently young people have less time than before . Because the world changes very rapidly , they have to learn a lot of things to catch up the changes . Imfomation technology brought us Internet which let us contact easily to the world network . Then , we have to check floods of information nowadays , while it was enough for us to check some specific information in old days . In adittion , recently young people have more complex job than before . They have to learn many things to do their job in order to get enough money to live . The second reason is the change of young peoples life . Many young people prefer to live in big city where do n't exist much communities . So they do n't have any insentive to use time helping their communities . It 's not rare case that they do n't know even the person who live in nextdoor . In conclusion , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
(FRE,medium) Education is one of the most important thing in human life , and we all known that education result in having good knowledge . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is it better than specializing in one specific subject ? We 're going to give our opinion in an argumentative essay . During our life we 're going to school to get more and more knowledge for being able to face on any situation , is evident for me that having knowledge of many academic subjects is more efficient that having only one about one specific subject . Having knowlegde is getting teaching from differents experiences during our life , whenever is at school , at home , in our social life or religious life . We can get advantages in knowing something about litterature , mathematics , geology , history , music , politic , geography , phylosophia and so on , because if you know something even if is not really well about these subjects , your mind is opening on every type of subjects . For example if you have to pass and exam which is about general culture , it 's clear that knowing some points about litterature , history of US , World War 2 , the origin of opera , and other subjects is more beneficial for you , you have more chance to pass easily the exam compared to another person who know everything about one subjects , for example if he know only everything about French Litterature , he ca n't talk with someone about sport , music or cinema . People who have a broad knowledge of many subjects ca n't be usefull in any types of situations , and they 're not handicaped by their knowledge , we can say that they 're an good and efficient help for the society , because they can come help someone who is in bad situation , for example if someone has been burned by a cigarett , the person who get a knowledge of many subjects , can help him . Finally , I agree with that it 's better to have a broad kn
(HIN,high) On one hand , many people feel that the advertisements create an awareness about the product and product 's features , while on the other hand many people feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I also agree that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Due to increased competion in this world , all the producers of a particular product wants to make a claim that their product is the best . For example , in the cola market , both pepsi and coke claims that their product is the best and contains all the features to make a person happy . While advertising their own product they also go ahead to criticise the other product . But the choice of each person varies for a particular kind of product , so I feel that the claim that their product is the best , is over advertisement . Another example I would like to mention here is about the soap products . Many soap producers show in their advertisement that due to the usage of their product , a person is looking very young and it is very difficult to guess that person 's age etc . While making this claim they totally ignore other factors that contributes to this appearance . A person can not look young by just using a particular soap . To look young , the person has to eat nutritious food , should exercise regularly and should not have much tensions . It may depends on lot of other factors too . But these advertisements totally ignore all these factors . So I feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to increased competiton and desire to succeed in the market . Due to this competion , while advertising the advertiser ignores lot of other factors which contributes to the desired results in the audience .
(JPN,low) In my opinion , the best way of traveling is in a group led by a tour guide . Because in this way , traveler who come to the unknown area can do sightseeing whrere is not only popular shops and buildings , but also picked up place by tour conductor who know all this place , and do not careful for dangour of the area . Traveler may not lost their way . If I had been in situation making traveling plan , I should have confused . In contrary , They can not make the plan for traveling by themself . If they would have thinking the place and building they want to go like clearly . In addition to , they may lose oppotunity like meeting with native and local people . Therefore I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
(HIN,high) I completely agree with this statement . There is no doubt that the advertisements do make a product look much better that they actually are . We should understand that the adverstisements are aired to make consumers familiar of a product and to promote its sale . If a company has launched a product it has to have maximum sale in order to have profits . So , they try to attract the attention of the comsumers by projecting it as the best product available in the market . Every company advertises its product as a super product as if no other product would ever be able to beat their product in terms of quality and price effectiveness . I feel that they try to fool innocent people for their own intrests . These days , companies project the researches about the products . They just project the good qualities of the product and hide the negative ones to mislead people . For example , they wiill air that the studies have established that their product is better that the product A , B , C and D in X , Y , Z parameters but they will hide the other parameters the product is not good in . I feel that a good quality product does not need any fancy advertisement , its quality speaks for itself and such a product will become popular with population just by word of mouth . According to my feelings , making a decsion to buy a product just because it is advertised as a very good product is utter foolishness and a waste of money . I , myself have been a victim of fancy advertisements . But , I learnt my lesson of not going by advertisements by incurring heavy monetary losses . I now feel that it is resposibility of individuals to protect themselves from falling into the trap that companies lay to extract money from consumers by advertising .
(HIN,medium) In next Twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is certainly true . Although today cars are the first choice of personal transport , it will be not in same in future . The time is changing the cities are becoming bigger and world is becoming smaller . Now is the time people dont live in their own big houses they live in big buildings were every one share the same ground . The people dont work in there separate fields they work in tiny places called office . The pressure on cities is growing and the density of population is increasing . The estimate percentage of people living in cities and in village will be 50 % by the year 2050 . All this bring huge amount of pressure to the transportion system , whcih the cities like Tokyo and Newyork is seeing currently . The city transport system cannot expand itself to accomodate space of each car for each individual . The future of transportation is MASS TRANSPORTATION . The cities need to bulld their transportation structure around the Metro trains and Mono rails . There Might be possibilty of private planes or some new kind of transport . Today they say That New york and Tokyo run as much as above the ground and underneath it . The crisis of fuel and the poulation issue may be handled by new invention but the problem of space will remain same in future also . The people travelling for day to day business will search for a cheaper and safer mode of travelling . The answer will be Mass transport only . The Car surely wont go out of market but will become a mode of leisure or fun . It will be a kind of thing which people will use in there weekends , just like bikes and hourse now .
(CHI,low) In the morden world , people always work so hard for their life , unusaly they forget to enjoy their life . There are bring a question tha if young people enjoy life more than older people do ? There are some people think that the older people are more enjoy the young people , the main reanson is that older people have enough time to enjoy their life . In my opinion , in fact that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . The reasons are below . There maybe one or two advantages of the old people enjoy life more than young people . For instance , that when a person became old , they did n't spend so many time on work , stay themselves to live in the world . They have their son to gave their enough money to eat and drink , they only thing need to do is that to enjoy their own life . But young people must spend their time to work , study , and so on . They have so many things to do , lead to do n't have time to enjoy their life . Alao , I agree that the time is limet the young people to enjoy their life , but constrant the advantages , this will became not improtant . The young people have some many typies ways for them to enjoy their life , in the morden world , there are have different choices for young people to play . For instance , that when after the whole day 's work or in the weekend , they can play football , basketball , and the other sports . There are not only goof for their body keep heath but also can make themselves relax . On the other hand , they could paly computer games with each other . Not only of this , there have many other choice like sing song , dance , and so on . But these thing seem to hard for old people , they move so hardly , and do n't have health body to play this thing like sports . They main way is to stay home watch TV or talk wtih somebody . The other advantage of young people enjoy life is that they have good health to enjoy their life . One person if do n't have good health that means so many things they could lost . There are is why i think young people enj
(FRE,high) Understanding is an important aspect of the student education nowadays . It is very important to understand ideas and concepts that should help the students to be aware on its subject . In some areas in the world and at a certain level of the education , student learn facts and do not try to understand the topic . This has a great consequences on the ability of students to express themsleves on any topic . Understanding concepts and ideas help students to implement the ideas and concepts they understood by trying to make realistic as possible . In the same way , students ability to to think is reinforced and their critical point of view would arise . For instance , when we explain a concept to a student and then we ask him to use that concept in his real life experience , he would be able to do it perfectly and at the moment we are sure that he understood instead of just learning the fact given by a teacher in class . Furthermore , a student who understands ideas and concepts should be able to give his own point of view in different manners . Based on my own experience I encooutered some students that learn facts and are not able when you ask them thinking question related on that topic to answer correctly . One day I helped a student to learn his biology lesson on root systems , they learned that are two types of root systems . I asked him to give me the difference between those types and I was amazed because he was not able to do that , but when I asked him to give me the two different types he started to give me all the writings of his notebook ; this means that the student did not try to understand but only learning . In conclusion , based on my explanation and support above mentioned , I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
(JPN,high) I think young people enjoy life more than older people do . This can be said from my own experiences and from what I see from other people 's experiences . One of the reasons I think this is because , younger people have more power or stamina to do things . For example , if a 50-year old person were to play baseball , he/she would have a hard time in hitting the ball and running to the base , and catching a ball and throwing it . As for the younger people , they still have a lot of strength and energy left to move around and use as much power as they want . Younger people have an advantage that they are able to move quicker and stronger compared to older people , so I think younger people would enjoy sports more than older people . In my own experience , my dad and I were playing catch . I could throw really fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast . I think this was because he got tired faster than I did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he used to when he was young . We can see that if we get older , our choices of what we can do will decrease . Another example that young people enjoy life more than older people is that young people can fool around more compared to older people . This can be said because if an adult were to jump around naked in his/her yard , he would get caught by the police . On the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around naked in his yard , he obviously would n't get caught . As you can see , older people have more restrictions compared to young people . In conclusion , I think that young people will enjoy life more than older people do . This can be said because younger people have more opportunities to do certain things than older people like play a sport , or go naked in your yard . I have never been old before , but in fact , I am having the greatest time in my life now , YOUNG !!
(CHI,low) When the issue wether the successful people should try new things and take rishs or only doing what they already know how to do well is of great interest to peopel . In my opinion , I perfer to agree the successful people should try new things and take risks for the following reasons : The first important reason of my view is people should gain more opportunities both in their life and in the career . Things chaned , People chaned . We are living in the growing fast world , trying more new things and taking more risks is helpful to find the new chance to get sucess . For example , At the end of last century , accounting people is considered working with the computer is useless , because it is the new thing for the people who doing in the information technology field and it also have to risk to change the accounting ability . I would say , the accounting people with using computer skills will success the job looking and keeping from who can not use computer in their work . The second reason of my view is people will get more self-confident through trying new things and take risks . Self-confident is most powerful thing today . Everyone can fail in their life . When we meet the pain , we should never give up to try . Believe it or not , failure is mother of sucess , You will work the problem out and feel happy so much , Futhermore , you got the experience for the further life . Beside the trying new things and taking risk , Doing what they already know well aslo should be considered . It is not easy to do everything well , even if you are familiar with . so doing you best to try new things and taking risks after you can do nomally thing well From what is mentioned above , I strongly believe and suggest people should keep trying new things and taking risk for the further . More prepare is helpful for your . Who knows what will happe tomorrow .
(SPA,high) In life there are situations for everything . In case of this statement I belive that there are certain times when the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but there are also sometimes that you want to travel with your family , friends or by yourself . It depends on your expectations of the trip and how you like to travel . Traveling with a tour guide is always much more practical and easier . Here , most of the time things work as they are supposed to work . Flights are booked , hotels have reservations , restaurants are good , times are scheduled and things just run easly . This is a perfect choice for a first time visit to a place . If you only have a couple of days , and want to get to know as much as you can , a tour is perfect . It will show you all around , the most interesting sites and what everyone talks about . In the other hand , traveling by yourself is completely different , here you get to make your own choices . You decide when you want to wake up , at what time and where you want to go to dinner and what museums you want to go visit . This is a much more relaxing time . It is a perfect situation for a second time visit , here you get to go to the places you most liked the last time you visited and do exactly what you want . It requires much more individual planning , well no one is going to to that job for you , but it also has certain priviledges . I also belive that a group and a tour is not a thing for everyone . You have to be tolerant with the other people around and you have to let people boss you . If you are not a type or person that likes to rush and be with a lot of people , traveling by yourself is the best choice . i dont think you can say what is best , you just have to consider the type of trip you want to have and the type of person you are . then you can make the right choice and enjoy a perfect trip .
(HIN,medium) Young people are full of energy and in possession of an active body and a healthy mind . They really enjoy life much more than older people . who are weak and frail . Young people can go for what they want to do . They have the vigour , stamina , active brain , sound health and energy to achieve their goals . While , senility makes a person dull and it also comes with many diseases , which leave their body inactive . If a young person has a desire to take a world tour then he can go for it . But , such ideas have to `` nipped in the bud '' by older people . They will not enjoy such adventure , but will create problems for them and their relatives . You are in demand if you are in the possession of a young body , a young soul . That makes life enjoyable for a young person . He feels himself wanted by the society , by the friends and family . On the other hand , older people are ignored by most of them . Most of the time they have to either read something or sit infront of TV . These all tasks make their life a bore . Older people 's life are like a train which has got an engine only and that engine is also malfunctioned and can stall anytime . Selinity also brings a kind of fear , discipline , misery , responsibilities , in older people 's life . They all contribute to stop older people from having fun . They have got a bad experience for most of the tasks which are enjoyed by young people . They , therefore dont dare to go for those activities once again . While a young people follow the quote , `` rules are made to be broken '' They go for it and thus enjoy the life . In sum , it is not that older people do n't enjoy at all but there are restrictions , which dont apply on young people . This world and it 's cumstances give much more opportunities to young people to enjoye their life . Old age takes away most of those opportunities . extent .
(ARA,medium) Understanding ideas and concepts by students is very important for them than learn facts on books . In my opinion , I agree with this statment because I have experenced this sitaution . when I understand something , I never forget it for long time but when learning a fact , i forget it easily . Most university courses should be understood by getting their ideas and concepts . Facts usually difficult to understand and to figure out how they work . Understanding the idea or the concept of something is a good strategy to learn because of some reasons . When I understand something , I know where it comes from and how it works . In my experence , when I get something with working hard , i never forget it while I read a fact , I might forget it easily because i did n't work hard to learn it and I do n't know where it comes from and how it work . In many universities , most courses ca n't be passed , if student could n't get the idea and concept of a specific course . For example , math , physics , chemistry , etc ... courses have a lot of ideas , concepts , and formulas have to be understood , so student can get good grades . Sometimes , facts are difficult to understand be just learning them because they hide what really is behind it . In other words , nobody can know the fact unless he understand where it comes from and how it works . In conclusion , students who understand concepts and ideas are better than those who just learn the facts because the student who learn the facts does n't know where they comes from and how they work . By experenceing many things that should be understand I totally agree with the statement saying that it is important for students to under
(JPN,medium) There are those who try new things and take dangeous risks , and there are others who try things which are already know to do well . From my point of view , it is better to do new things even though there are a lot of heavy risks . There are several advantages of doing new things ; new experience and sense of achievement . First of all , I can experience new things and gain my knowledge . As I try and challenge new things , I would find something important and valuable lessons that I do not know . For instance , I am joining in swimming club right now . Since my coach moved to new swimming club , new coach came my club . Of course , new coach did n't know my major stroke which was free style . I told him about my major stroke , but he recommended me that I should swim at competition as breast stroke swimmer . I was surprised because I never challenged to compete as breast stroke swimmer and that competition assembled very expert and elite swimmers . But I wanted to try my best . Before the competition , I practiced so hard and asked my coach how I can swim breast stroke fast . As a result , I could swim the fastest breast stroke in my life at the competition . I learned from this happening a lot . Second of all , when I try new things that are never experienced , I would feel sense of achievement . If I try same things that I know how to do well , there is no feeling after I finished those things . I would feel boring and tired of it to do . But when I try new things , I would feel exciting and passion to finish those new things as perfect . I would collect data from intruments such as Internet and books and ask friends how I can do well . If I finish my works to do new things perfectly , I would feel sense of achievement and exhausted . Considering all of above reasons , most of people think it is better way to try things that I already know because they wanted to do well , but when it comes to me , I believe that people should try new things even thought there are a lot of dangeous risks and difficulties . People should learn valuable lessons from new experiences and feel sense of achievement .
(KOR,medium) I strongly aggree with the statement that yong people enjoy life more than older people do . I think yong people have less resposiblities than older people . Older people have to earn money and take care of their family . For this reason , old people abandon their time and life for their family . Otherwise , yong people does not have such a responsibility . They spend most of time for their own life . In my case , I spend my time on playing games and sports , doing habbies or watching movies . However , my parents can not enjoy what they want to do . They work every day to support us . Therefore , I think that enjoing life depend on the haviness of responsibility . For other reason , yong people are more energetic than old people . Even if someone really enjoy playing harsh sports but is not energetic enough , he can not do those sports . In my experiment , even when my family goes vacation to mountains , valleys or beaches , my parents can not play longer . They exhaust faster than I do . Thus , I agree with that statment . Furthermore , yong people are more opened at many entertainment system than old people . As time passing , many entertainment system that did not exist in past has developed . So yong people have more chance and more choice to enjoy their life . In these reason , I gree with the statemnet that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
(TEL,high) I clearly disagree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . The only constant thing in this world is `` change '' . Things are changing from the way they used to be before . Man is also changing . The phase of his life , when he used to find it difficult to earn his daily bread has almost come to an end . The living conditions have been improving . Man is able to earn enough to support his , as well as , his families needs . Man has become a very busy animal with his appointments , meetings , business and many more issues which demand most of his time , caliber , intellengence and effeciency . He also has his daily chores which he has to finish before calling it a day . To keep up with all this he needs fast and convinent transport to help him reach his destination on time . Car is a convinent mode of transport for him . It is no more a status symbol . It has become a necessity . It a very common thing , nowadays , to own a car . The advancing technology and the need for fast transportation result in more people owing cars . Apart from fossils being the primary source of fuels to ignite the engins , new forms of energy are also being developed . One among them is , trapping of the solar energy . Cars can now be run on solar energy . This eco friendly development is a boon to man . He need not spent mpre money to just fill his cars tank with gas . Hence , I opine that there will be an increase in the number of cars rather than a decrease .
(GER,high) The problem we are dealing with is the lake of interest of young people to spend time to helping their communities . It is a big problem that needs to be solved . On the one hand , there is a rising number of requirements young people have to deal with . There are a lot of things to manage . Nowadays , young people have to do good results at school or at the university to get a well-paid job later . Most of them are expected to make a good career . They often have a lot of hobbies or activities and , last but not least , they also have to manage their social life . All these activities take a lot of time , sure . On the other hand , there must be a solution of the problem , we have to look into its matter . First , there has to be a good time management . Young people should learn to spend their time useful . Adult people should support the young people with good advices or with more . Parents can suggest a usefull activity to their child . They could drive their child to a soccer game and pick him or her up after the game to do some work in the helping center for homeless people , for example . Parents also could suggest to work in a local helping-station for animals . It could be interesting work for a child , where it can learn to be responsible and to take care of others . Moreover , social work would increase and improve the social skills of a child or a young man or women . That does mean , that this young person may become more able to deal with problems or to solve conflicts in his life . It also could mean that the young person will simply be able to communicate better with others . Whereas the young people have already enough to do is actually being debated . Despite all sorrows there are a lot of advantages of social work and work for communities . This work does help both sides .
(ARA,low) yes i do agree that broad knowlege is better then a specific subject at times > if a person is taught just one subject they will be ignorednt is the rest of the things in the world causing misunderstanding cultures or religions which will rlead to woar and the end of the human rasise
(CHI,medium) Should we study in the specific subject as some people content ? I agree with this point insofar as that as a college student the major course is important for us . However , those people might begs the question by neglecting the fact that the `` ture education '' means having many different area knowleage . When I face with this situation , I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic . In one important aspect , studying other subject is clearly accurate in the extent that every subject could connect with each other . They could not stand by their own , for example , without the knowledge about math , chemistry will not do the correct the data from the lab . In addtion , for `` ture education '' the more significant consideration is that in the modern society , we need many differert subject knowledge to have our own become more competitive when facing the development of the technology . Any observant person could list the adequate to illustrate this point , consider the development of the computer . If we do not know how to computer , which company might employ us and how we get the so many information around the world ? Aside from the two propositions mentioned above , one caveat might come along with having too knowledge of other subjects . Specializing in our major subject provide the us to get the certain job in subject . The contrary side of board knowledge would mirror a too-narrow view about the true education and its adequate objective . I would admonish that extending the point too far may risk having a chilling effect on the university study . In sum , even though I prefer to have broad knowledge about the different subjects , no area of the education could operate in a vacuum . To becoming `` true education '' , we must strike the apt balance between the major study and the pursuit . Whether means of education is justifiable must be determined on case-by-case basis by weighting the benefit of the individual and society .
(ITA,low) today there are a lot of services for the people , for travel , for study , for having a better enviroment , for every thing to simplify the life and enjoy the people . There are so many solutions for every things , many things for give a better life to everyone . A great part of these solutions are dedicated to enjoy people : every kind of trasport like car , train , plan , or every kind of place to go like disco , pub , swimpools or fitness center . All to we enjoy .. But I think that young people today can enjoy better than older people did . I 'm a young woman that lived in a time where all I would have or do I could have or do , but I also lived in a small town , where there are not so much service than in bigger city , but i do n't think it 's a bad thing . I had the possibility to live in the nature , walk , play , study and feel me good and happy for the small things and , aboveall , I had no kind of stress like the older people did . Now , that I live in a bigger city than mine , I 'm often stressed and nervous for every things I do or think . It is not only a my problem , every day I see around me people that feels like me . They try to make something for resolve this problem this why they go out often to go to fitness center , in the night to the disco or to cinema to watch , often , some stupid films that , they hope , can give them a pause in their stressed life . I also think that a lot of things that we do today for enjoy are not so simple and natural like we would , and there are created so much services to try to resolve this great problem of our society .. we are not more able to enjoy like ours parentes . That 's why todaymore often
(FRE,medium) Nowadays , our society is surround by advertisements . Everyone who wants to sell his product need to advertise . The purpose of the advertisement is to show this product helping people to know about it . Differents ways are used to this purpose , television , newspapers are the most famous one . As a common sens , when you want to sell your product you will show it in a beautiful way ... the most beautiful wway , of course . So do the advertisments reflect the reality of the product ? Do what we see or listen is thruly representative of it ? Some people say that advertisements show the product only in his most beautifull way and effectiveness . It is not question of showing it more better but only as it is . Others disagree and argue that advertisements are misleading . Emphazises of the products lead people to understand the product in a wrong way and , most of the time , must better than it is . I completly agree with this latter point of view . We can see it in differents medias . A lot of people experience deception when buying a product that does not fulfill their expectation . But the advertisements pledged the reverse ! As an example , a lot of commercials on television boast the veru of candles having a nice sents . Thoses sents will stay in your house for a long while . People who made the advertisement conviced you that this candle is the best one . And , how disapointed are you when you realise that , after few minutes , your candle and beatiful scent are gone for ever ... The fashion newspapers are one of the specialists in this matter . TA big part of their pages is dedicated to advertisement . Why ? one of the reasons is that fashion magasines make people dream about luxury items , lavish lifes of actors , etc ... People are more able to fall in the trap . For example , an advertisement of a yacht next to a picture of star laying on a overseas beach will help you to sell your product . It make you feel taht you are buying a part of a dream ... your dream . As result of the misleading of many advertisements , we can read in the same newspapers , an increase of the number of law suits . Poeple are sometimes so disapointed even loose money that they call an attorney

(ITA,medium) Culture has to be very important for all people , it is better thet eachone know much information about differet argoment and topic . It is very beatiful study many academic subjects because you could discover much things that you do n't know . At same time I think that for working is better to specialize in one specific subject . For example before the last reform of school Italian university give you many academic subjects and less specific subject , you study in university a lot of book and after university you do n't know the way for enter in word 's job . For a students is very difficult understanding the applications of information in a jo . I think that the general academic subjects is important for myself and specific subject too . The best way for me to improve your culture and found a good job is that you have to learn very well all the informations that school give you and after that , during the work , this information have to use for do a good job . Now Italian University is building in a different way than the past . You study for 3 years many academic subjects ( many information about a different kind of disciplins ) and the and of this 3 yeas you have a degree of first level . After you decide if you continue your studies or not . If you continue to study you can choose one specialization and learn one specific subject for 2 years , during this time yuo at the and you have a degree of second level . In short I think that is better that I learn many academic subjects for improve my culture and my life at the same time I learn one specific subject for found a job that I like me .
(GER,high) I think their are advantages and disadvantages of both - broad and specialized knowledge of an academic subject . I am studying `` European Studies '' which is a really broad field , students joining academic courses of the history , socialogy , economy as well as politics department . It includes a lot of devotion to stay informed in all of the subjects . Therefore , I experience advantages and disadvantages of interdisciplinary studies everytime discussing with specialized students . It is e.g. true that `` interdisciplinary '' students have a broader view of the world and its various developments , however , when it comes to theoretical background , we cannot compete no more with the `` specialists '' . Economy and society are both demanding people who are able and willing to learn throughout their whole life in various fields . The `` new '' employee should be trained in a lot of subjects being able on the one hand to find new solutions to problems and connections due to his multi-facetted education and on the other hand to adopt to new circumstances quickly . I would therefore argue that it is more favourable studying many subjects for entering `` real life '' business . However , one should always be aware that one has to concentrate on one major in order to have a reference point of one 's academic and professinal outline . This core subject should be the starting point of one 's ideas and itentions giving rise through the surrounding subjects to innovative ideas . However , if one wants to enter an academic carreer it is favourable to have a specific knowledge of only a few subjects in order to find and teach new insights necessary for the acedemic development of each subject . In conclusion I argue for a break-up of the dichotomy of broad and specialiyed teaching . Of course , students should take a decision at the beginning of their studies , but even if they chose to become specialists they should get some broader education to apply there skills in various fields . Apart form this I would advice students of a interdisciplinary course to dicide for a kind of major to concentrate their efforts . Both are needed and their interactions have fruitful outcomes .
(HIN,high) I do not feel that young people enjoy life more than older people do because I believe that they are also humans ans every human enjoy 's his life to fullest and to the best of his capacity . Even though there idea or way of enjoyment is different . We should also not forget that these old people were also young someday so they know much better than young people the defination of `` Enjoying . '' I do not feel that older people enjoy life less this is because being a human they always have a desire of enjoyment . There may be the case that there ways of enjoyment is different as compared to young people because of the constraints such as age or physical disability which comes with age . For example for the young people enjoyment could be doing mountain climbing or playing basket ball but because of age they are not able to do all these activities . Instead they love to go for a walk or sit with friends and have coffee which young people find boring . This made them think that old people dont know enjoyment . They tend to forget that these old people were also young and have done all these activities . Secondally , I feel this because older people also have various responsibilities toward their work and families and being old society also expects that them to be responsible for their actions but young people are generally away from these tension . Even then we find older people laughing and always present and supporting these young generation . Thirdly , Older people with their experience and intelligence which grows with time know the proper defination of enjoyment . It does not mean trying out risky acts such as driving a bike at high speed or keeping your both hands free , which younger generation find the idea of real fun . Instead they know that it is a shear stupidity and not fun . On the other hand you will find older people driving slowly and listening to a romantic music with their better halfs in side or you will also see them with their grand children and singing a famous nursery rhyme . At last , I would like to conclude it as that the older people find their happiness or they enjoy when their family is happy , when these younger people are happy . So , it would be very wrong on anybody 's part to say that `` young people enjoy more life than older people do '' instead it should be said that '' Older people make younger people to enjoy. `` because all the tensions of life are taken by them and the younger people are left free of all problems .
(ITA,high) I think that there is no real decrease in the amount of time that young people are dedicating to help their comunities nowadays compared to what was usual in the past . As far as I am regarded , what really has changed is the way people , and youngsters as well , contribute to the life of their communities . Until less than one century ago the family was the center of the comunity and most of the social needs where covered trough the help of the family members . For example , if we think about the care of elderly people , it was almost entirely carried out by family members , thereby reducing the need for help from the surrounding community . Of course this required all the family member , also young people , to take an active role in the family life . Nowadays is not the same anymore and in order to have the same `` services '' is required an higher involvement of the community , since the family , having changed so much , is no more able to take care of the same functions and require support from outside . This means that there is a greater need for volunteering inside the communities but at the same time pepole should be able to dedicate more time to the community , as they are required to do less within the family . The same is true for young people , who are in fact active in a lot of fields . I myself was for several years a volunteer for an hiking club , and devoted most of my sundays from spring to fall to lead groups of kids to the mountains to discover nature . Some of my friends have been involved in care of elderly people and some other are volounteering for the red cross . Of course those occupations are not taking all of the available spare time of young people , there is always the chance to do a little bit more , and there are some who are not contributing at all , but I think that there is no real ground to say that young people in general are not helping enough . Most of them are doing their best to help out .
(HIN,medium) When we are young we are more energitic , more powerfull , more encouraging and also more willing to do new things in every part of life . So i think yes young peoples enjoy life more than older people do . People who are older cant enjoy that much how much younger people can . Younger people can go for trip like rock climbing , rappling and all which old people cant . Because of there heart problem or even they get tired very easily because of there age . Normally old peoples dont go to collage for studies and all where young peoples have most of there fun . They can new friends , go for parties with friends , can go for trips and all . Which old peolpes cant do because of there health . Take an example of new year when every young peoples go for parties and all , then they came late at night and again on other day they go to collage with that energy and again have fun which tell us that life is more enjoyable for the young peoples . Normally each and every young people like to drive bikes and car very fast , they know that its very dangerous and even i know that they enjoy that also . Which after an particular age they cant enjoy . Even you can see in live world that every rock star , actors and good dancers are normally young . There can be old also but mostly they are young . Even all cricketers or athlics are young who can enjoy sports in that particular age limits . This all tells us that more or less young people enjoy more then old ones . So from all the points above we can note that young enjoy very much more than old peoples but every old goes once from young .
(ITA,high) In contemporary society , specialization in one specific subject tends to be the most common thing . Some people spend all of their lives studying a particular year of the life of a king , or some kind of abstract things related to an unknown topic of algebraic topology . This kind of people tend to extremely focus their point of view on a single topic , and to examinate it in every side . I think that such an approach to an academic subject is a bit limitating . In my opinion , one should have a broad knowledge of many academic topics , rather than fossilize himself on a single point of a matter . First of all , I think that everyone should have a personal amount of knowledge , and be prepared at least on the basic things . Everyone should know , for example , that the earth orbits the sun and not viceversa !! Some people , instead , may know everything about the poetry in South Italy between 1900 and 1910 , but ignoring at all such a basic thing . This is rather an extreme example , but it is what happens in practice . Another point pro having a broad knowledge of many subjects is the fact that there are many things that diserve to be studied . The world and human history are so rich in beautiful things , that I think it is a crime to not take them in consideration . An objection to what I am saying could be made : such a way to proceed , that is to fly from a flower to another like a bee , could lead to nowhere . Acting this way would bring nothing more to society . No improvements can be reach . My opinion is that to invent something new , it is necessary to grasp relationships between things . For example , it is the contrast between Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism that lead to the theory of Relativity . No one would have though to Relativity if thinking to Classical Mechanics or Electromagnetism separately . For this reason , I think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .
(ITA,low) All days we take car to go at work , take train to transfer from a city to another , buy various type of electronic machine , on all of this actions we can watch a million of danger situations ! On the train we can read uppon the window that is very danderous put out the head or put out bottles , during drive car we can watch many traffic signals that remember the maximum speed permitted , or finally when we buy a washing-machine we can read the book where are write all instruction to what do and what do not . This are the advertisements that daily we can find in the life . Just when we are child , parents show what is dangerous for us , `` do not touch this '' is the mainly phrase that it is said . During the grow each child decide what is right for him and , sometime to follow the fashion , make bad decision for himself like smoching cigarettes and joints , or go around with not very good people . Sometimes an advertisement could seem very eccessive , like how do not put a cat in the microwaves , but not all people are able to think what is right and what is not . I think that it is impossible know whether a person is able to choose the true way to make somethingh , and so it is better if other write sample instructions for him \ her . Finally I definitely disagree the statement because we cannot know when and what is really dangerous for us , and so I think that is better follow the instruction .
(TEL,medium) I strongly agree with this statement which says `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . Nowadays , commoding by cars has become a major problem as it takes or kills lot of time in travelling because of drastic increase in traffic in the country . And one cannot really control the traffic instead one can travel by motor bike or take goverment service ( by train , bus or air bus ) . So in next twenty years technically we can hardly see people travelling by car . One of the most prominent reason could be , people are not secured when they are travelling by car as they see many acccidents occuring in the cities without any mistake . People usually might visit late night parties , clubs , discos and people may cosume alcohol and after that driving car can lead to disaster as drunken driving is anytime not advisable . The other reasons can be , when you are going on a long drive and if your car breaks down and we really cant fix the problem in that situation we have to call ourselves helpless and there could be any problem we might have to face in such terrible situation . But when one travels in goverment service and one can really enjoy all the benefits been offered by the goverment in that particular bus or train . One can also consume food , can sleep , chat , play , etc ... and the best part is that they can travel safely and in a secure manner . We are all aware of the fact that human beings are very intelligent and they really have idea of what the importance of life is and would prefer to take a secure mode for travelling instead going by car which is anytime not safe . Finalyl , i would like to conclude that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use as people love to travel with different modes and are fully satisfied with facilities that they are getting in different mode of travelling than travelling or using cars .
(JPN,medium) I think that it is more important for the students to learn the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts . The reason of ideas and the concepts are more important is that learning a certain subject will be much easier to be understand by students . Students have different ways that they learn . Some of them learn from facts , but most of them learn from ideas and the concepts . Most of the time the facts can be difficult to understand . Teacher can teach the students the basic ideas and the concepts in order to understand easily and quickly . For instance , the first few weeks in my government class my teacher taught by using facts , but most of the time , many facts were confusing to me . Then , I asked my friend for help , but most of my frind that I asked were confused on many government systems . After , I talked to my teacher on where I was confused on and the way he taught us . I requested to him to change how he taught the class and he did the next day . My teacher use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts of the whole structure of government systems and laws . I learned many valueable and interesting informations that I did not know . Also , my teacher made this subject easy to understand and more entertaining so that all of his student can focus and get interested into this subject . If my teacher did not use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts , I would not understand the whole structure of government systems and the government systems and laws . In conclusion , learn the ideas and the concepts is more important for the students than it is for them to learn facts . From my eperience , using ideas and the concepts can , not just facts , improve learning skills . Class taught with using ideas and concepts can be more understandable .
(HIN,high) The issue at hand is '' Do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ? `` . Yes , I strongly agree with the above point . In today 's developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product . Firstly the general public or the customers who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance . Advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan 's and they start using that particular product . For example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality . In this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are . Secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images . They are visually more appealing and attractive to look at . Due to the use of multimedia technology more and more clients get attracted and buy the product instead going for their properties and long lasting nature . For example in an advertisement its shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible . So again advertisements seemed to make products much better than what they really are in real life . Thirdly advertisements lead to the increase in the sales of a particular product whether it is really good or not . Many companies use advertisements to increase their sales of product . Their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit . Furthermore many of the firms use advertisements as an intelligent weapon to show superior features in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product . So i strongly feel that advertisements enhances the product than what really it is .
(CHI,medium) I disagree to travel around with a tour guide . It will be great to travel around the places that we like is to travel by ourself because if we travel by ourself , we can spend our time freely . We do not have to care that the guide is going to go somewhere in a few minutes or they are going to spend a lot of time at the places that you do not really like . It will also be relax to travel by yourself , you can wake up in the hotel whenever you want , you can go to eat anything you like in any time . Ane you can also have changes in your trips . In order to have a good trip for ourself , it will be good to just go to the places that we like and spend our time in the things that we are interested in . If we go with a guide , we only have limit time in all the places . And there might be some places that we do not like . We always want to feel relax on our trips . We are not there for business , we are there to have fun . So if we go there with a guide , we will have to followed the rule of the guide and we will have to get up in the time that they want us to get up . There will always have some accidents in our trips and it will be good for us to make some changes in order to solve those problems . But if we go there with a guide , our plan has already been decided . We would not have any chances to change our plan . For these three reasons , I recomand that we should go on a trip by ourself but not be leading by other people .
(FRE,high) `` The new Generation '' is a very critisized topic these days . Young people often give out the example of a modernised generation who care about nothing but temselves and how to stay entertained . Even though young people always seem to be preocupied with themselves , they do care , in a way , about helping their communities . It is true that they do not show it as much as older people do but that does not mean that this new generation does not care about helping their communities . After all , they are part of their community , so by helping it they end up helping themselves . For example , young people will tend to help their communities by making it seem more enjoyable . They will plan numerous activities for different events , like trick or treeting and costume parties for Halaween . By doing that they entertain people of all sorts of age : children will be happy as well as their parents who will enjoy spending time with their family . Now of course this example might not be very revealent for older people who think that by helping the community you must decrease the number of unemployments , help the elderly , organise charity events ... but younger people , are not always aware of the importance of these sorts of problems , which is why they do not give it attention . This does mean that teenagers do not care about these social problems but it will take more time for them to understand how important they are for the community . By saying that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' , we give out the impression that they are spoiled kids who do not give attention to their environment . That is why i disagree with this statement . Both teenagers and children help their society by not even noticing . For example , they are aware of not throwing their rubbish on the streets . By knowing that they help decrease the pollution rising in our world today . Of course , they would not be helping their communtity as much as adults do , but it is a fresh good start that proves that this lack of care of the `` new generation '' is not always true .
(TUR,high) In these modern days , every each person wants to be successful . I do n't know if they want it because of surviving or just for their egos . I recognized that there are really much more people are becoming successful . why ? I think they are doing the right things that they already know how to do well . There are reasons but first , people can start what they want to do with experience and second , sometimes taking risk can cause to go deep and fail so people would n't have a chance to get things well . I think experience is the most important issue . For example my mother always tells me to wear socks but I never do it until I have got a really painful stomachache ! And I always tell my mother not to warn me about anything because when bad things happened to me I understand well . there 's another example that , my father is a pharmasist and I want to be a pharmasist too . why do I want it ? it 's all about my father 's experiences . he knows everything about pharmact so I can use his knownledge . I see my father is working and I know how he does it . I do n't want to be a teacher or engineer while I have already have my father as a pharmasist . Sometimes people want to take risks but trying new things is not safe at all . If they want to have a business they have to think about first and they should get informations or help from the people who have experience already . I think this is such a mindless thing ! Being a successful person is not so easy like leaving everything to chance . Sometimes people need to be excited , and taking risk is a exciting thing but it may not brings luck . If people want to survive and have a good life they need to be successful so they must do everything well . I 'm sure if they have experience they would be lucky because they would make their life easy .
(ARA,low) ads Making the productes seem much better than waht really they are is become very commen latly . Diseave the people by shooing them a very nice shape of a productes , is one of the most technec which used to sell the material . for instance , when you go to the grusary store , you will see alot of beatufll cans of sudas and tastes grate . in the other hand , no one comprehande what the result of drinkink this . For sure , those are totaly unhealthy products . they are doing that for several resons . the frist reson is , making the advertising is not easy as what the people think . it is too difucalt and the company which prduce the producte payed a lot , in order to have a good advertisments to hook the people attention to their proudect . Besides , they wo n't lose their mony in short and selly avdertising , because this might affcte in the prodact negativly . the second reson , selling the bad productes usually needs a very stronge advertisment , which might incloded a beatufll girls . If i were a company owner and the producte of my company has been dicreasing the advertisment is the only way to improve the seal of my productes . However , the truth is my productes are bad . In summary , `` the advertising in the air '' this experisen explane how does the advertising are very nissecary in our live latly . and the advertismente could be used in eather ways in good or bad . it depance on the persone fathe .
(ARA,medium) The advertisements is very fast way used in currents days to purchas , to sell , to find fast your needs of different items that the humans requires . The advertisement is to have show about items or things such as house , land , workers by televisions , newspapers and magazines or even through internet . This essay focus on that most advertisemens make products seem much better than they really are . Some people think that using things which is advertised is very beneficial as they are seeing that things in tv and news papers , for example buying furnitures through inernet . this is very unusefull way as the conditon of the furniture is bad or good not seen . Morever , through newspapers , if buying cars , that care will showed in nice photography whereas in the reality is very bad and damaging condition . In addition to , all this things will end in wasting of the money . Its often belived that going to sale place and seeing the items befor buying , renting or using is good , therefore the person can checke and find out if any damage is there . For instance , buying used house hold items and equipment must be checked before taking . The most adventage of that is first , time consuming to search and be satisfied with your goods . Secondly , It is money saving . It seems to me that Advertisment shows the product much better than real picture of the things . People should check and find out the correct ways to purchase and market their things in order to not to be in situaion where they feel they have been cheated , Also the traders must be honest when marketing and selling their goods .
(HIN,medium) `` The ideas and concept tends to create an intellectual '' This proverb helds equally good when we talk about learing process involving proper understanding and concepts . It is not only , holds good for the student alone , but also holds good for each and every individual who are in the process of learing . though since the students are building blocks of the future generation , more emphasis should be given to them . Besides , learing facts contributes very little in actual learning process . The very first point why the students should learn by understanding ideas and concept is that because once the students understand the concept , he/she can easily apply the concept in any field to solve the probem . No matter how difficult the problem is . For instance , in the regular classes of maths and physics , where the subject is occupy with full of formula and facts , it is very difficult to memorise all the formulas and facts stated in the book . But if student understands the ideas and concept then he can probably derive many formula by a single standard formula , then , in this case he / she does not need to remmember all difficult formulas which will be very exhaustive and time consuming . Moreover , if the students only try to know the facts then there is a possibility that their knowledge will be narrow . what i meen is that when the problem comes which he/she is not aware then it will be very difficult for them to solve the problem because they only know the use of facts in one particular place . Whereas , if the student has understood the concept and ideas then he / she can solve any of the problem by virtue of the underlying concept involved in that problem . On the other hand , learing facts also contributes in learing process upto certain extant . for example , in chemistry , until and unless students learn the periodic table , it will be very difficult for them to understand the rest of the inorganic chemistry , Hence , in this case it is imperative for students to learn the facts also . To sum up , in majority of the fields , learning ideas and concepts are more beneficial because it gives the solution of a problem all the time . Nevertheless , facts are important in fewer condition when compared to learing concept . But in general for the good knowledge and proper understanding combination of both would be better choice .
(ITA,medium) More times , when we watch the television , we can watch different kind of advertisement , but , the products that we look , are really wonderful as the television seem us ? Or the products seem much better than they are ? We ca n't answer a these questions , but we can inferre that the people that makes this producs want to sell it , and so , he will use all means that he can use for to sell his products . If he wants seem us that his clothes are impermeable at every liquid , he can do it because the television seem much better than they really are . Not only the television seem us these chose , but everything that make advertisement such as the radio or the advertisement on the internet . If i must say if i 'm agree at this type of advertisements , at this false advertisements , i must say you that i 'm disagree , because people 's mind ca n't be manipolated by these persons whose uses the special effects for to seem us that their products are wonderful and useful . In italy , for exaples , some months ago , there were a case which many people had paid thousands euros for salt and magic water of people that said to be sons of the haeven , seeming in the television their magic powers . Obviusly were all false . People that use the poor mind of some people , second me , must to be punished with the law .
(JPN,medium) I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I have three reasons for it . First of all , it would not be good , if you have some kind of specific things that you want to see . Because of too many people , you have to come back within a time and you can not spend time what you want to see or experience . I think it is better to travel by yourself or with small numbers of people , if you do have . Therefore , you can spend , experience , as much time as you want . You do not have to care about time or others . It will be your own travel , not for travel for everyone . Second , if you travel in a group with a tour guide , it means that you can not do whatever you want . You sometimes follow orders , such as time and going to bathroom . For example , you have to see whats in the tour . You might not in interested in the things , but you have to walk around and see with groups . Another example is when everyone goes to a bathroom , you should go there , too . Otherwise , you might want to go to bathroom later . But it would bother others and kill time for everyone because you travel with others . You always have to think and caqre about others . On the other hand , if you go by yourself , you will be able to skip what you do not want and spend more time what you want to see . I think you can enjoy your trip more without caring others or stress from others . Lastly , I think it is good for you to travel by yourself before trip , such as when you make plans and study about the places and cultures . Because you have to travel by yourself , you might have to research about the places in detail in order to make your travel better one . You also might have to study about the languages they use beforehand . Then you will get opportunities to use your research and languages over there . I think after the travel , you will become more familiar with the places , cultures and forth . I am sure you will never forget the travel because you created . ! If you travel with others plan , through the agent , I do not think everything will be perfect or satisfy you throughly . I guess you will complain with something at least once because you do not make it . In conclusion , I think the best way to travel is individual . Then I think you can spend as much time as you want , study about whatever you like , whatever you want to do . Also you willl be able to make a trip more enjoyable and better one than plans that others make . Because of those reason , I would prefer to travel by myself , but not going with a group led by a tour guide .
(HIN,medium) Advertisements have become an important part of our daily life . We rely so much on the advertisements and bring the product to use it . But , most of the advertisements make the products look much better that what they really are . I totally agree to this . I have heard lots from people about the superficial advertisements whose products are really bad and i have too experienced it . There are lot of hair related products like shampoos , conditioners and hair styling products of different brands . I have dry and weak hair . I happened to see an add for shampoo for dry and weak hair . There advertisement poised a model having silky and strong hair after using it . So relying on the advertisement i bought that shampoo and used it but to my surprise i didnt get even okay results . Basically they try to sell their products by making progandas about the product but actually it is not satisfying at all . Lets consider the example of fitness intruments . The advisements shows that if you will use this product you will loose so much pounds , if you will use that product you will loose some more pounds . Since in US obesity is the major problem , so people rely on these adds and bring home the instruments . They do loose some of pounds but it not the same pounds they show in adverstisements . In most of the adverstisements , they will just show beautiful models and celebrities to make their add fancy than it actually is . I want to tell one of my friends experience about the cell phone service . She took one cellphone service watching its advertisement talking about the better quality of phone calls and best customer care services . But she is repenting her decision of using that service because of bad voice quality and more worse is their customer support . In my opinion , not all but most advertisements tend to make their product look better that what it really is . So , in my view we should not blindly rely on these advertisements rather we should learn more about the product and should compare with other products .
(KOR,medium) ` It really works ' this is what i can hear every commercial . Every products are not best in the world , and sometimes it does not work . However in the commercial every goods are fabulous . In my opinion , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than their real . Advertisements exist for advertise the products . Even though , the product is really good . there is a limit of until everybody know about this product . Because of this reason , people want to make commercial . For instance , near my school , there is a really delicious restaurant . Almost every my school students know about that restaturant . We get imformation from our school friend . However , my friends whose are not attend my school , never know about that restaurant . The other day , the restaurant itroduced in famous TV show . After that the restaurant is all the time crowd . Even my another school friend know about that restaurant . The restaurant has a purpose when they are on the show . It need to provocate customers . Many people buy products that they do not need after watching commercial . The advertisement need to stimulate to customers . Owner of products wants to sell products as many as possible . Getting to result , they need more strong tihings than their real products . Therefore , they make their products more fancy and looking good . If it works products can earn lots of money . When i was young the castle for doll was so wonderful in Tv commercial . I keep asked to my parents to buy that castle . Finally i got that , however it was so different from the commercial product . Colore was different and there was no bell and It was not automatic . Even though commercial disappointed me , it was enough to make me buy doll castle . In conclusion , most advertisments make ptroducts look good better than real , I think that advertisment has a purpose . Because commercial 's initial work is advertise to people and via stimulate customers make them buy to products .
(FRE,high) This is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education . Indeed , the task of education is to teach students a lot of theories , ideas and concepts . That 's also why we learn philosophie in school , to learn to doubt , to think and analize . the follow quotation of Montaigne shows the real question : `` It is better to have a well established brain that a full brain . '' But both ca n't work separately : we need comon knowledge to learn how to take a decision and how to behave in society . History shows us the way to behave with other countries , mathematic shows us how to deal with other countries , geography teaches us how to reach other countries and languages allow us to speak in other countries . The comon knowledge represents all ideas , concepts and theories we need to make the right decision and understand our environement . Despite all of this , one day , students have to use their knowledge in a practical field to experience the profit of it . The increasing rate of internship demonstrates this need of ` facts ' . Education requires always more from students without teaching them the real work they are attending for . That 's why , there are more and more private schools that offer a practical schooling with a long period of internship . University realized this problem few years ago and tried to adapt themself to the reality of the market . To conclude , I would say that this is a central question in education field . In my point of view both are as important . The question is no longer to know if we should teach ideas and concepts but more to know where is the border between ideas , concepts and practical facts ?
(CHI,medium) City born and city bred , I have long been accustomed to the sight of passing vehicles . Now that I , as an engineerer , have more oppurtunies to observe the hallmark in the history of invention and have noticed any sign , at any moment for the time being , the fall and decline of cars . They are in radical demand in a number of rising countries and technology advancements empower them the novel vitality . Among contemporary powers , US , Japan and Western Europe , the more cars people possess , the more is needed for the simple reason the refinements , replacements must be done over two decades and the thriving marketting of new styles stimulate the need while average income of people in these regions grant the desire . Let 's go a step further into the rising nations , China , India . A bief glance at the strenuos road building craze will dispell any douts on the pressing demand of cars . Some people suspect they , as well as Americans , Japanese and Europeans will be concerned on environmental issue . More often than not , the majority , especially in developping countries will consider the properous automobile industry and other areas which have some bearing on it the priority . However , countries that are sufficiently technologicall prepared may take sturdy steps to update , instead of abandoning the car . As far as I can see , automobile is such an indispemsable element of western culture that deserting the car is equivalent to disposing the contention in freedom . Cars embody the culture of fully controlling one 's life and the significant sign of being entitled to pursuing the personal aspiration . Hence , I definitely believe the recession of cars will not occur at least in the near future , so close as twenty years . But one thing is certain , that automobiles will take on a more fantastic appearance to gratify the aesthetic appetite of consumers and adopt more features , say , automatic navigating , hydrogen fueled to be friendly . The possible massive possession of cars in developing country in twenty years is approximately written in stone .
(ARA,low) I beleive that having abroad knowledge is agood idea , but after having that huge eruption in informations , could this be possible ; The answer is `` no '' , because the student will spend all his life trying to cover all the academic subject . In the ancient days this idea was mor applicabe , because the quantity of information in all topic was not that huge . Being specialized at a certain field means that one can put all his effort and direct his talent . It is important to clarify that these jumps in all fields come over when there was that speciality in dcademic fields . its important to remind that a success in a field leads to another one in different field ; inventions in phesics area such as electricity , radioactive matters leads to good tools and instuments in the field of medicine .
(SPA,medium) First of all , I thing this statement is something very common to listen nowadays , but I think it is n't true . Each new year it is true than the young people is more busy in a lot of things , but It 's a social problem , bacause they have to study , to work , to learn other languages , and more to can find a good job . I think this is the main reason to say that the young people do not give enouth time to helping their communities , but do n't they study to improves their knowledges and with them help their communities ? I think so ! For example , lot of young people use their summer holidays to go to places where they can rebuild old buildings , or help old people , ... On the other hand , I suppose that is very important the education that they have received in their houses , if their parents were woried about teach them the importance of the enviroment , helping old people or mantein the places cleaned , I think they try to have enough time to do that . However , I can understand the statement bacause nowadays everybody live very fast , I mean , you have to do one thousand of thinks during the day and frecuently you have n't time to think about all that isuues , nevertherless not only young people , but also everybody . Finally , I wish everybody had a little time a week to think about this and do something to solve this problem .
(TEL,medium) most of people use car as a part of their daily life for travelling . there are other ways of travelling like moter cycles , aeroplanes and trains but these ways of travelling have its own drawbacks . consider the case of motercycles : these are felt useful only when travelling distance less than 10 km . if the distance increases we feel uncomfortable with motercycles . moreover people see car as a status symbol consider the case of travelling by means of trains : teh train timmings are fixed and are not flexible to our reruirements and the facilities are not htat much good in all trains . we must be there at station strictly by time if we are littile bit late we will miss required train consider the case of travelling by means of aeroplane : though the facilitie s in planes are good it is suitable only for travelling larger distances that is more than 200 km and more over cost of travelling by planes is not affordable to every one and timmings are not flexible to our requirements . construction of airport requires huge land and capital now consider the benfits by travelling in our own car : firstly the timmings are flexible to our requirements . we fell more comfortable in car than motercycle or train . it also reflect our status . in countrys like india people strive for status and most of the people buy cars to show their status . more over in car around four people can travel at a time saving travelling fares . we can travel to rural areas were travelling by train or plane is not possible . we can enjoy reading books magazines novels etc and listening to music sitting in seat behind driver . we can even watch movies traveling in car . we can stop at any place we want . more over complete all our works which are in the route by travelling in car which is not possible in case of travelling by train . Thats why i agree to the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer in use than there are today ''
(JPN,medium) I agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Some people reccomend to know the facts , but I think tstudents should understand them first because of the improtance of knowing the basic information , the possibility to misunderstand the facts without basic knowledge , and getting ability to think about cause and effect . First of all , students usually lean from teachers with textbooks because textbook have the important information for studnets . I understand that knowing facts is also somehow useful for students and they can learn other things which are not indicated in textbooks . however , it is more significant for students to learn subjects from basic . Secondly , I do n't think students can understand the facts without basic knowledge . Not all facts have regular environment or situation like indication of textbooks , so students may misunderstand the facts which is irregular . However , if students learn basic knowledge first , they could recognize what is regular facts and irregular facts . Some facts require people to learn advenced knowledge to understand them , so it is more critical for students to study ideas and concepts first . Finally , if students know the ideas and concepts , they could think the cause and the effect of facts when they face the facts which they have not learned previously . Moreover , just knowing facts is not useful for them because facts are not always normal . Students can not recognize facts accurately without the basic ideas and concepts . Thus , I would like students to learn basic knowledge to understand facts . In conclusion , I believe that students should understand ideas and concepts first before learning facts . Not only students but also adults can not understand facts without basic knowledge . If they do not have them , they would misunderstand the facts . This is not good for students . Therefore I strongly reccomend students to study the basic ideas and concepts to recognize facts .
(HIN,medium) Even at certain extent so called Fact itself based upon the particular ideas and concepts behind it . Basically the whole matters of this world depend on particular ideas and concept of its existance or creation . Here if we dont understand the ideas or concept of particular thing then we take is as fact and we accept it as it is . So i would certainly cent percent agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas or concepts . Because , if we want to understand the thing as a whole then we need to conceptualize that thing , we have to understand the content from the grass root level of that matter . Then only we will be capable to solve the puzzle behind it and can explore the real eternal truth based upon the logical conceptualization and critical thinking . As for the example , if the student want to learn the Math taught in his class then he needs to understand the basic concept from the fundamental level itself . So that in future he can build his further study or professional career based upon that distinct concepts of his subject . Another reason I would like to project is that if the student accept the study matter or any thing as simply as it is explained without getting the rational or logic behind it then there are more chances for student to flunk in their exams , especially when they just mug up the things as one of the fact or phenomenon . This kind of attitude towards study may endanger them in their future prospect whenb they go in thier professional life . Thus , I would l ; ike to conclude that students should understand the ideas and the concepts rather than facts .
(ITA,high) I neither agree or disagree with the previous statement ( or better I recognize its unavoidable reality ) , I will provide below my reasons ; I do n't appreciate this practice , even if I understand the reasons which lead the advertisers to adopt this technique to promote products . The first reason is simply practical , many products do not look as nice in reality as they appear in advertisements , for example as regards pasta , usually experts use plastic copies of pasta in the making of their video advertisements , because pasta is difficult to be managed and to look in an acceptable way for the long times needed to record the videos . The second and main reason is cause of marketing , people working in this field believe and know that people do not use a product because they need it , but because it represents a dream , an illusion , under which something else is hidden : the individual need to be socially recognized , the need to look in a better way , the need to look someone else , etc . So usually advertisements depict an illusory image of products , full of colours and brightness , with dreamy contours , in a rich and pleasant environment , etc . For example if we consider a car 's advertisement , we could notice that we do not see only the car , perhaps moving on a street , usually we would hear a very rithmic music , after we would see the car , perhaps in front of a luxury restaurant , a man in an elegant suit would come down and open the other car door to allow a beautiful , sexy , girl to join him entering the restaurant , perhaps at the end we would see the couple , inside a villa , on the border of a pool , drinking two glasses of , seemingly , champagne , naturally the car is always in front of the view . Does this all reflect the real life of most of us ? I would say no , but it reflects our dreams , our hidden desires of social power and recognition . They do n't sell a product , they sell a dream . Concluding my discussion , I think that the topic the question is about , better looking of products in advertisements than reality , depends on the way our society is structured , a way in which appearences predominate on essence ; so I think it 's just inevitable , it is not a matter of agreement or disagreement .
(GER,medium) In the following essay the topic if it is more important for students to learn facts or to understand ideas and concepts shall be discussed . My first example has to do with the variety of chemistry aspecaly the organic chemistry . If a student wants to broaden his knowledge of organic chemistry he has like is sayed in the introduction two possibilities to do this . He could on the one hand start learning millions of different molecules and wayes to produce them . On the other hand he just could learn the different ways of how special classes of molecules are produced . The second way would give him a general understanding of how the synthesis is working and for what and under which conditions he can apply it . This would give him the same abbilities as the student choosing the first way but he can get to his target in a much shorter time . He also will be able to learn new things relating to the learned things more easy because he can relate this new information to already learned stuff . The person using the first way has to learn everything by heart and has no chance to make it easier or quicker . Looking on the using of the knowledge the first person will always know directly what he has to do to get a specific molecule while the second student has to think about it and search for the right way for producing the same . But again the second student has a benefit if it comes to a molecule not known by both students . He will solve this task as just explained but the first student will be completly helpless . Summarizing what the given example shows it has to be said that understanding general ideas and concepts is faster to learn for the student and makes him more flexible in using his knowledge . This brings me to the conclusion that the understanding of ideas and concepts is a lot more important to learn for students in my opinion .
(TUR,medium) With in today 's busy and hard life many people suffer their life instead of enjoying it in my country becouse of economical and other kinds of problems but I think I am the one of the luckiest who can enjoy a part of it . I do n't see the issue as an age matter but I take it as the ability or opportunuty to enjoy the life . Although it 's meaning chances person to person , enjoying life means being happy , loving someone and marry with her , having a healty baby and going to a concert or a movie for me . And I recon these things are all about money at the begining and human effect comes next . I mean if you do n't have enough money to do these things then you may not experience their pleasure so you ca n't be satisfied . Another point is the human effect which relates the issue most and it means wish or want of a person to be happy in his or her life . For example if you have money and wish to go to outside for a dinner , then it is so simple for you to do this . Otherwise if you have money but no wish or vice verse then you can not have a good night so I think lifestyle does not depent on age . In adition to these two major points , I must state that your social enviroment has also good or bad effects on your life . For example you may live in a place where there is no movie therefore you can not go to a movie even if you have maney and wish . In summary , I live my life as much as I can enjoy it and this depends on my opportunties but so many people may not take a lot of it 's good points in my country and I belive that enjoying life is all about your wish and ability to do so .
(GER,high) I disargee with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . Firstly , I do n't think enjoying life depends on the age of a person . In my opinion things like getting along with one 's life and the ability to stand bad and hard situation are more important in this context than the age of a person . And , for example , the ability to bear grave moments and siuations normally raises when people mature . According to this , older people have even an advantage : They can stand bad situations better and so they are more able to enjoy their life again , when the things got better again . Secondly , I know many old people who really enjoy their life . For instance , my grandparents travelled a lot in the recent years and they really enjoyed it . Another example is a old , retired man I met in my university : After his retirement he decided to attend several philosophy courses about topics he had been interested in since many years . And watching him participating very engaged in those courses , I really thought : This man enjoys his life ! All in all , I 'm convinced that this statement isn ' true . And I hope I also will enjoy my life when I will have matured . I think one reason to provide such a statement may be to be to much focused on leisure time : If one equates enjoying life with enjoying life , than young people surely have an advantage : Simply because they have more leisure time since they do n't have to work . But having no obligations , like to work , does not mean that a person is happy . Another fact that the person who made the statement probaly had ignored is the following : Young people may seem more happy if you see them in the streets , but you do n't know how they feel at home . I remember the grave
(ARA,medium) There are many differences in the world from the way it was in the past , young people are one of those categories which were effected by the changes . I completly agree with the statement that young adults do not give enough time to help by giving a helping hand in their communities . There are many reasons for this thought , first , the young adults were not raised by their families to carry out the responsibility of a person other than themselves , food is provided to their tables , plus as much money as they want without any kind of work no matter how old they are ! And as a result there are some who ca n't be responsible even for their ownselves let alone contributing to their community ! . Also , we ca n't deny the many attractions around young adults , which makes it impossible for them to be part of any positive community work many movies , gamesand other attractions which had made them forget any kind of resposibility . Finally , some young people have a very negative ideas about themselves , and they have no positive feedback from the elders of their family or community , they always procieved with coutions from people around them . All that and much more could be the factors behind the low number of young people participating in community services .
(FRE,high) Obviously , it ca n't be denied that most advertisements try to insist on the qualities of the advertised product , and cautiously hides their dark side . As a result , the consummers , who are the targets of the advertisement , may think that the qualities of the product are better than they are actually . The very first reason supporting my point of view would be that i can barely imagine another goal for advertising than highlighting the qualities of the presented products . And to do so , magnifying the greatness of your production is an appropriate way . For instance , i can remember an advertisement for a washing powder which pretended to make your clothes ` whiter than whiter ' . That may sound a little bit ridiculous , but that 's part of the deal as far as we talk about advertising . Another reason explaining that behaviour can , most probably , be found in the growing competition on consumer-goods markets . The marketing theory teaches us that if you want to overcome your opponents , you have to choose between two strategies : you can either improve your product , or you can advertise it in the proper way . For some categories of products , only that last strategy is available : for example , as computers from various brands are all made with the same components , one of the only ways to distinguish yourself is to advertise your production properly . But , on second thought , we may challenge our position in some ways as it is to be noticed that , on some occasions , advertisements does n't make products better than they are in real . First , the law generally prohibit advertisements that would purely and merely lie about the properties of the good you sell . This limitates greatly the possibilities for advertisement to make products better on screen than in real life . Second , you ca n't exclude the possibility of having such a great product that it would be totally useless to exaggerate its faculties in an advertisement . Finally , and that may sound paradoxical , some adverstisements seem to minimize the presented products . The idea is to tease the consumer who is surprised because of such a strange message . We can quote the example of the British car brand Bleinheim which present their luxury cars in a pretty poor way .
(FRE,medium) Older people are generally considered to be more responsable than younger people , because they may have responsabilities that oblige them to analyze situatuations before acting . Let take the basic case of parents and children . Children generally receive money from parents and they do n't have responsabilities or duty that oblige them to save this money . They general spend this money with friends in night clubs , pubs ... Another axample is risk , older people are more risk adverse than younger people , they tend to do what ever they tink can be exciting . More and more we can see young people with cars doing races without thinking about consequences of those actions . what i think an older wo n't or will think a lot before doing so . Furthermore , we use to hear this from older people : we did this a long time ago . From this we can say enjoy life is a cycle and every depending on his age has to go by this step . I think young people really enjoy life more than older do and this because older people passed their turn . Enjoying life is a kind of cycle and every human enjoy life when he has less responsilities or duties .
(KOR,medium) People easily concludes that a specialized knowledge regarding a particular subject is urgently required , however , this will not only isolate the person in ` society ' but also will isolate from the ` trend ' , that of the world . The person possessing a tremendous knowledge in one subject without understanding the rest , will have a strongly fixed view - point toward the world , since one learnt only a part of the world . The person will not be able to accept other 's point of view or understand it , because he or she will be too much concentrated on one subject . therefore find themselves hard to recognize different world . Leading to the social isolation as one will not permit him/herself to accept and understand others . The person will also be isolated from the trend . The international society is now leading to the trend of globalization and the active interactions among the nations . When one keeps such a limited knowledge regarding society , he or she will not be able to understand and anticipate the changing trend of the world as the international society is interacting in uncountable areas . As a result of complex interactions , a concept of international studies now advented , which deals with various international aspect that includes literiture , science , politics , business and such . Therefore , if one contains knowledge in one particular subject , leaving out the rest , it will not be easy for him/her to follow the international trend . Nevertheless , if a peson possesses a variety of knowledge , one will be able to understand and accept other 's thoughts since one will be aware of the fact that there exists countless point of views . Also , one will understand and predict the trend of complex international society since one will be enlightened of how various subjects interact with each other . Therefore , one should be able to reach oneself to the variety of knowledge ; first , to understand other 's point of view and effectively communicate with them , and second , to allow him/herself understand the interactions among subjects and how it influence the international society .
(ARA,high) The following statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. '' is a faulse statement lacking evidence to support such an argument . The passage below will demonstrate , through three examples , how the above statement is inaccurate . Firstly , if the population of the world continued to educate their children , or adults in many subjects then the world will have too many people that know a little bit about everything and none that know accuratley and condensly about specific subjects . If we take the case of Jordan or Saudi Arabia , we find that the education system has proved to be less successful than that in the west , namely the A level , or IGCSE system . Studies have shown that students tend to do badley when the education system includes many subjects . The English system for example , has proved quite successul . We find that students tend to choose subjects of interest , and tend to focus quite well and progress flourishingly at university since they focus all their efforts at subjects of interest and tend to excell . It has also been proven that if a student enjoys a subject such as Math they tend to do considerably well , and may never excell in subjects they dislike due to the left part of their brain working better . Studies have shown that the human brain is split into to categories , the more creative side , and the more mathematical side . It is upto the subjects to excell those parts of the brain more considerably . Secondly , if indeed we broaden the knowledge of students into many subjects , we will find a lack in quality in nearly everything . If we take the following examples , we find that in disciplines such as Architecture , Urbanism , or even Medicine ; a need for an accumulative time frame where constant knowledge is used to develop in such subjects . If an Architect , did not spend an approximation of ten years learning and mastering the topic , then the work will be far less than perfect . Ofcorse , it is always useful for one to learn more about other subjects generally , however it is important to relate them back to one discipline to actively excell in a particular topic . Thirdly , we find that at Postgraduate level , the reason the world is moving forward and excelling in terms of technology , science , and what have you , is due to researching specific topics at a higher level . A PHD professor spends all his time focussing , and detailing a single topic for 3 to 11 years , and that is when the subject moves beyond it traditional scope . We also find that respectable institutions have continuously been re-inventing new topics of education such as Human resourse education , and emotional intelligence . If we strived to learn all topics in their totality , then we would lack sufficient resources to keep expanding and creating new forms of education . In conclusion , we find that one needs to focus and free himself of external factors in order to succeed in life . As illustrated above the definition of success is the amount of knowledge one has gained in a particular topic to the degree where he has created and invented a new form of language to offer back to the world . If we all attempt to learn about many topics in general , then we will loose the devoted time to excell in just one . As mentioned , and supported in the examples above , the art to mastering a topic is to devote much time to perfecting the information up to the final elements . As the saying goes : `` God is in the detail '' .
(CHI,medium) Young people nowadays really do not give enough time to helping their communities ? I agree with that . Though some student club form for helping those old people who live alone and spend time on helping their communites , most of young people do not care about that . Because in now days , everthing changes so fast , new things are invented everyday , they attract young people eyes . Young people have more things need to learn than old time and there are not so many communtiy activities hold like old time . That is why young people nowday will became like that . More and more new things are invented to occupy young people 's time . For example , internet , the greatest invention in 20s century , according to researching of scientist , teennager spend more than three hours a day on chatting or browsering website on the net . Of course they wont have time to give their communitis . New things means new knowlege , young people nowdays have much more things to learn than people old time . Parent may sent their children to piano class in past , but parent have lots chosis , computer , painting , language and so on . My friend 's kid comes home at nine o'clock because she need to attend two classes after school . In old days , people always celebrate holiday by holding lots activies in community . That makes peoples who lives in the same community to know each other , but nowday most of people do not even know the name of the people who live next door . Of course , young people do not give their time to community , they do not event
(ARA,medium) The next twenty years are not a big span of time to show major changes in human acts toward technologies and toward global interactions . But as a matter of fact and as the world is getting flattened i think that people of the third world will learn from other nations how to get organized and establish a well , advanced infrastructure in the field of trasportations , as they act as an obstacle for decreasing the number of cars in my openion . As we see in cevelized countries all classes of society even the wealthy people uses public transportation because its well organized and the people are well educated about the polution issues and they not only but acts about it , but on the other hand we see how in the third world people brag about there 18 years old kid has his own car . But thanks to evolution in every aspect of life , people are learning from eash other and as petrolium is getting higher in prices , nations are getting advices from eash other on how tosave energy an making a verey advanced transportaions like busses and trains . for an example i used to reach a certain place which is away from home 5 min. by the car in 35 min when i take the bus due to lalk of organization but now after five years it improved to ake me 10min which is acceptable . Anyhow i am optimistic about a future with less cars and the key to that is by well educating the people about the problems being encountered by the increasing number of cars , and to offer them a convenient substitution .
(ITA,high) Risking or hesitating ? In my opinion taking risks is something that makes your life worth living . Off course taking risks is not something that all the people are able to do , because you may have to put up with the eventual negative effects of having done a certain choice . So if you have a strong personality , if you are audacius , you can go throgh the `` experience of risk '' and most of the time you will have positive feedbacks . In my personal experience something happened that makes me strongly support this idea . My father has been working for all his life for some technology company , but one time he had to handle with the terrible `` mobbing practices '' which are conceived to put a person under a psycological pressure . He decided to leave the company before being fired , and so he took a great risk putting our family in a condition of economic uncertainty . Then he took another great risk deciding to start running is own bussiness . Right now he is really happy and satisfyed because everything is going in the right direction . I 'm not telling that everytime you take a risk there will be something more positive waiting for you , but if you 'll never try to do that you might regret the fact of not having been enough brave . Furthermore if you keep on doing something that is really familiar to you , something of which you have a perfect knowledge about the possible consequences , you won ' never experience excitement and your existence will be flat and annoying . So taking the risk is something that everybody should do , in order to gain self-confidence . Because most of the times this is a way to understand as far as you can push your limits letting you know that possibilities are infinite .
(SPA,high) In our actual society , which is currently developing faster and faster everyday , it is necessary to be posted on many new findings in diverse fields of science . Since every field is getting broader as it goes , one may have to choose between having a general knowledge on several fields , or specializing on a certain matter . I choose the second option . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good thing , if you can handle it . In order for that to happen , one would have to study different areas , which would leave less time to know deeply each and everyone of them This would mean that , although having knowledge on many subjects , they would be somewhat shallow . In contrast , it would give you a large list of subjects to talk about with friends and family . On the other hand , specializing in one specific subject would lead a person to have a profound understanding of the matter . It is what everyone expects from proffesionals in many fields . For instance , no one would like to have a surgery if he knows that the surgeon who is going to procede does not know much about the matter . You might as well get killed with a gun if that is the case . This example is suitable for any other field , such as economics , or even music . In proffesional matters , a person who knows more on a single matter is more apreciatted than one who know too many little things . To conclude , I would say that both kinds of knowledge are important , but having to choose , I would go for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many subjects , because it is more important when it comes to being a good proffesional , whatever career you choose .
(HIN,high) Yes i agree with the statemen , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' as people gain success they experiment with new ideas and takes risks of implementing those ideas . The main purpose of this experiment is to increase their growth and success in fields other than what they already know perfectly . For most of the successful people success is not the only goal , but their goal is an increase in success with the passing time . I think risks must be taken so as to explore other fields inorder to achieve success . Success of an individual depends mainly on his self confidence and his skills in adapting what he dont know . Trying out something is the basic step of attaining success or failure . Only after trying out something that is new people are directed towards success or failure and in case of success people try to expertise themselves in that particular field and later on try for some new things to add on to their success . An organization which is successful in providing people with a soft drink of a particular flavour will later on take a risk of trying out something new by introducing a new drink , if it fails then the drink may be withdrawn from the market but in case of success the gain a huge business and sales . Success it attained by dedication , hardwork and skills , a successful person feels independent and keeps on trying new paths or ideas to increase their success . But people who dont try new ideas maintain the same position at which they are present since a long time . Success is achieved by taking riks and implying new ideas , new ideas are helpful steps and a right path for people who are successful .
(TEL,medium) I completely disagree with the statement given and i dont even find any sort of idea like that . i dont understand if there is decline of cars with in the next twenty years , then what the people are going to use after twenty years ? bus , train , bike or plane ? all of them have disadvantages compared to cars . compared to all the vehicals available today cars are the most efficient vehicals to meet the requirements of all the people . if people are going to stop to use the cars , then how are going to travel ? either by buses , trains and even planes . all these cannot be efficiently used by the people . even if people have decided to travel by other means of public transport then also they should have a own vehicle to got a station , airport or bus stop . if the people should go by buses or other they should get ready very early , go to nearby stop , wait for the bus , get down at the destination and then go to the office by other means or by walking . is this process better or getting into a car at home and getting down in front of the office is better ? definitely the second one . now a days people are looking for vehicles which gives them a lot of advantage and cars are one of them . every one should have a own vehicle for their daily things to go on without problem and car is best of them . like other vehicles ( like bike ) there is no need to expose to sun and it is a comfortable way of travelling . as it is not much expensive to buy a car , every one could efford to buy a car . in times of emergency we cant wait for a outside vehicle to come and car means a lot at that time . so it is the best way to travel at any time to any place comfartably . the only disadvantage of using the car is probability of accidents . we sholud be very careful while driving and have to keep the whole attention on that . but if we go by public transport there is no need to worry and can sit in a relaxed state till the destination comes . but inspite of this disadvantage cars serve as the more efficient way to find the needs of the people .
(GER,high) The understanding of ideas and concepts together with the ability to reproduce them correctly is the best way to learn something new . But the more important part from the learning in general is definetly the understanding , because only if a student understands the idea or concept , he/she will be able to use it successfully . To explain my point , I will try to give an example , where we can see that just learning facts does n't help in real life . Let 's assume that a business student , who always had good results in college , starts working in a big company and has to work on a very difficult case . This task includes a number of problems , which seem familiar to him , but he can not use the results he had learned from university , because they do n't fit in this case and he never really understood the concept . He has never done it before and has to solve this problem by himself , because otherwise the senior manager will recognize that he has n't got a clue about the topic . Now , he will recognize that the stuff he had learned without understanding it , does n't help him at work . Which might lead to a lot of problems for him . I think that we can obviously see on that example that learning facts ca n't be more important than understanding the idea . And even if someone can probably pass college or university without realizing this statement , he will do , when he starts to work . And do we only learn for good results in school ? I do n't think so , and that is by the way what all the teacher in my school tell me as well . We have to understand what is behind the facts , so that we can use the concepts . And for that , I would like to mention that a student have to learn the facts , which is also important . Only when these both factors of learning come together , we will be able to learn for life and use what we have learned successfully .
(ARA,low) I agree for shor . haw can the studens pas the exams haw can the be the best ? I think thes is the reale questhion . Ideas its the way to under stand the facts . So if the student len haw to the , if the studen lern how to use ther ideas the will can araived to the fact . most poeple do understand the fact but mos poeple can not araived to the ideas . If we teech students the wat to understand ideas the will lern the fact emegetly . the ideas is the topec of the facts . lrenikg the studens the ideas have many advantegis : First , the will do good thing to ther contry by giving them same ideas . Socend it will help them to be a good persons ik thes life . Last but not least it will help them to pass in the school , in the unevercety and in the life . that wy we should lren them the ideas
(GER,high) Even bad marketing is marketing . In my opinion a successful person is someone who takes risks and tries new thinks . I am the best exmple for this statement : Two weeks ago , I had an interview at the Walt Disney Company for an internship . of course I could have come to this interview as every one else : nicely dressed , conservative and serious . I would show him my image of a good teammember and some other strengths . So I would have had a nice interview and maybe a chance to get the job . But I wanted to get a better chance on the job : So I came as the comic figure Daisy . I wore a white blouse with a Daisy pin and a nice skirt , combined with a pink bow in my hair . I knew that my behaviour was not usual and I was aware of the risk I was taking with this strategy . First of all , everybody looked at me when I came in , so I got the full concentration on my person . It was a little bit risky , because this attention can be positive or negative , but for sure they will remember me . Furthermore , my interviewer could see that I am an outspoken person with motivation to get the job . Of course , the image of Daisy matched with the job offer I was applying for . I had to fight for the very first minutes of the interview to give the interviewer the impression that I am still a serious , conservative and trustful worker but it was worth it . The interviewer gave me the job right away and when I asked why he decided so quick he said : You applied for the job in an unusual way and showed me that you are able to think out of the box . Actually , we were looking for someone who takes risks to achieve his goals and you are this person .
(ARA,high) Human beings always want to learn more , and gain more knowledge . Knowledge is a very broad and complex in relation to the human brain . People may like to learn about everything they can lay thier hands on , but when does it stop ? When do we draw the line to where we should stop gaining any new knowledge ? Should we even consider stopping ? Gaining a better knowledge of many subjects may be very usefull in a way , because it shows that a person has a very broad understanding of subjects . The human brain can only take on so much knowledge . When learning about a large amount of subjects , human beings may neglect the specific facts and the little details because of the extensive amount of knowledge that people are not able to process fully . The human mind is a very powerfull tool , but it is impossible to learn about so many academic subjects . Considering how short a human being 's lifespan is . Having a broad knowledge of subjects can help society in many ways , it also strengthens the mind because it is always processing information . Eventhough having a broad knowledge of subjects is usefull , the world still needs human beings that are able to specialize in one specific subject . Human beings that do no neglect the specific detail in that subject . This broad amount of knowledge in one subject is needed to be able to excell in that area of study and to be able to invent new elements in that area of study that can help mankind in the future . People that specialize in one subject can ussually expand a field of study more effectively then people that have a broad amount of knowledge of many academic subjects . It is always usefull to gain as much knowledge as one can get , but because of the limited focus on details , it can be extremly hard to expand in any subject . That is why people need to work together in focusing and specializing in different fields of study to be able to excell and help society as a whole .
(TEL,high) I disagree with the statement saying , `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . '' I believe in the other way around stating , `` It 's better to specialize in one specific subject rather than go for many academic subjects . '' I am going to provide some of my personal experiences with specific examples in the passage . Personally , I feel I have been off track since my schooling as I needed to go for many academic subjects . I used to have knowledge on various academic topics every year . Once I got into higher studies , some of my subjects were of no use and I was made to stress only on certain subjects . From then on I never practically or theoritically implemented those subjects which I left off long way back . If I were to be specialized in any one subject I would have been a more knowledgeable person than I am today . Secondly , having specialization in any one specific subject can build a person in a right way . The person could be able to make a research in the subject he learnt right from his childhood . It makes him more motivated and results in an obvious expansion of the subject whereas in having knowledge in many academic subjects could really limit a person 's true potential and ability because there will be a time factor in this case and the person may not be able to make up the time for research purposes . Finally , another advantage of specializing in one specific subject can make less burden on the children who are made to carry bundle of books daily to schools and colleges . Studying only one subject can make this work a bit easier . More over the students can spend their time equally in theory as well as practical classes which is more important for a human brain to work efficiently . There must be more practical knowledge of the learnt subject rather than only book knowledge . The student must be able to apply what ever he learnt in his/her practical life . I would like to conclude by stressing my point that it is advisable to have knowledge in a specific subject rather than opting for many academic subjects . More over by specializing in any one subject of student 's interest or choice , it helps development of research in vast educational field . There is more scope for individual development here .
(GER,high) Since I am a business student with focus on marketing , the topic is very relevant for me in my everyday life . First of all , I have to say that there is no doubt about the effects advertisement has . Using several tecniques to present a product in the best possible light , some of the consumers may get the impression that they do not receive the complete pieces of information about it and a realistic picture . However , although there may be some tricks to sell products more effectively , no single marketing man in the world has magic abilities . To start out with some arguments that support the above statement it should be mentioned that print media especially offer opportunities to give the product a better image . Most important are possibly pictures that can be turned into perfection easily with computer programms . Additionally , the information given in newspapers or magazines are in fact putting special emphasize on the product 's qualities instead of its eventual disadvantages . To give an example , a special feature of a mobilephone such as the great design or the modern functions would be probably printed in big , coloured letters while the expensive conditions of the speaking tarif would be printed in small letters in a corner of the page so that most readers would pay no attentin to it . Another trick of advertising professionals is to work with people 's emotions . Awakening positive feelings by showing impressive and colourful spots with a certain connection to special situations in life , the associations with the product the watchers have and therfore his opinion about it would be more positive than without having seen the commercial . As one can see , there is a diversity of ways for selling a product in a maximum of positive light and although there are a lot of norms that refer to ethical and moral doubts in the society about modern advertising methods and that have to be obeid , companies know how to make use of little tricks . I do not completely agree with the statement because , as I mentioned at the beginning of my essay , the product is only a product that can be `` tuned '' in some way but not really improved in the impression it makes . Additonally some ethical and social norms prevent people from being tricked seriously by ad
(GER,high) Do young people enjoy life more than older people ? Or does age even affect the satisfaction of each individual ? These are two questions that will be discussed in the following essay . Several arguments will be presented and evaluated . First of all , the assumption can be made that younger people , especially in Germany are offered more opportunities than ealier generations could ever experience . The educational paths provide a large variety to develop oneself and to choose a career that suits one 's interests . Next to the formation of the academic curriculum , possibilities to create free-time activities are almost endless . Should this freedom which is offered to the young people however , have an influence on how satisfied they are with their life ? Older people in contradicition are more limited concerning the above mentioned aspect . Many did not have the possibility to select their work as well as preferred lifestyle according to their major intersts , due to the second worldwar . This issue might lead to the fact that they regret that they were not offered such a large amount of opportunities . Furthermore , health issues might lower the quality of life with increasing age . I believe that the question should not be if older or younger people enjoy their life more , but rather if age is one of the significant factors that has an influence on overall satisfaction . In my opinion , not age but rather the optimistic or pessimistic point of view each individual has , decides about his or her quality of life . This characteristic is absolutely independent of age .
(ITA,medium) I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . The first reason is that the car is necessary to do most of tha activity that a person does . For example , if a person wants to go to swim and the swimming pool is far from his home , he take his car to go there . The car is very important for the family . Infact parents need the car to bring their child to school or to go shopping . Another reason that I think will make the number of cars increase is price of them . Infact forty years ago , for example , cars were very expensive and so only a part of the population could buy one . Today there are lot of different models of car and almost any family can buy a car . I think that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use also because they are reaching a very high comfort level . Today a person can have a long trip without arriving tired . Another reason is that cars are being more and more safe . For example twenty years ago if someone have to make a long trip he probably had taken the train . Infact if a person had an accident with an old car he probably hurt himself seriously . For these reasons I think that in next twenty years the number of cars will encrease a lot .
(TUR,medium) Being Successful Some people try to create new things and take risks although some people only doing what they already know how to do well . Being good in my work and getting success is important for me beacuse i am trying to do my best . Some people thing if they do what they already know they will be successful . Thats not such a bad idea . But , on the other hand some people look the situation like that they thing if they can produce or try new things and take risks they can be more successful . In my personal opinion trying new things and taking some risks is the best thing that you can do in your life beacuse you should find new things for the next genarations . Besides if you can find new things you can be more important business man also you can get the success easier . As an example if i had a big company i would like to see my employees that they are trying new things while they are working . I will share what i thing and ask what they thing . After we discuss some things i will choose the right desicion . For doing that you can be a good business man or a good employee . In the meanwhile there are some bosses that they only want from their employees just do what they know how to do well . Doing something good is important as well but if you are a man who is n't open new ideas and you are't produce new things you are not be a good employee or a good boss . Despite for all these resions create some new things and take risks to being good in your job and show something for the next generations otherwise you would not do your job good in this life .
(ARA,low) Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities cause these days the life situation its too difficult for live , cause they want to pay for them to have an own salary the dont want to go for example ; to the hospital and ask the patient how did they feeling about the helping them in the painfull or how the nursing treatment them & how the attitute from the doctors or nursing or about the cleaning for the hospital , if we try to push the young people to help their communities they must give them a good payment or recomandiation to opening for them later a door for agood expereince & give them a good community with apoor people & how to feel about poored people , Then we can find alot of young people come to the communities and ask them to help cause they put a benifites for these young people for example like : 1 - They give them a monthly payment . 2 - They give them a recomandiation lettere to help them for any work they will apply for it . 3 - They give them an experiouns . 4 - They will always try to push them to do a good things . So that the young people they will have a time to help a communities and they will be happy for do that cause they feel they indeppendent on them self . Finally I hope the young people they can find a good communities opened a door for them and give them what they need to take from them and Iam sure they will do they best and the better even in hospital or schools , company and on stage .
(ARA,medium) To answer this quastion lets foces in each one of them and then see wether the young people enjoy life more than older people do or not . The young kids should play and have fun . basicly because they should leave their age . as the sceince aprove that childrens games improve their experince in life and activate their brains in a very importent way . in the same time , childrens have no responsebalties to worry about , so they have alot of free time . let 's not forget that their bodies are young and they are full with eneragy in a way that make it hard for them to get tierd . also , most of the childrens have no medical problems . in another word they are healthy . in contrast the older people have no time for that . in nowaday the normal adult person have an avrage of two jobs , because of the economical issue . so working for an avrage of 60 hours in a week will give the person no time for any kind of fun or even time to rest . in another word , adult people have a lot of responsebalties . another exaple of what make an adult person life busy is social networking . every one have people he know and he should maintain his networking . another responsebalty witch will make him busy is the relationship or family . so as i present at essay , the young people are having more fun basicly because that their age style look like .
(HIN,medium) Ideas and Facts are two sides of the same coin . While ideas bring about new experimentation , new technologies , new behaviourr , new ways to do things ; thier success brings about facts . I personally beleive it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts as well as learn facts . Facts usually gives the basis of an idea . They know that this is what the charatersitcs are ; they can formulate an idea with the existing fact . Focusing on only one facotr , i.e An idea or fact would mean invitng more errors or having things done the monotnous way . For example : new techonology have been invented in the recent past becuase of new ideas being generated ; however , the existing facts about the present technology has helped them develop news ones . Knowledge of facts helps students realise the limitations and the strength of a certain subject . Concepts on the other hand are the basis of understanding any subject . If a student has not understood his concepts well , he would be unable to understand the fatcs and not bult up on ideas . Concept is the backbone of both ideras and facts . For example if a student ubderstands Newtons LAw of gravity , he would understand that every thing around is attracted by earth . Once he understand the concept , he can understand the facts about gravity and then built on new dieas to built a parchute or an aircraft . Ideas , Concept6s and Facts belong to a viscious circle where one thing is realted to the other and cannot survive without the other . Now , if students are exposed only to concepts and told to built on ideas then they might be building the same things which is already exisiting , or they might repeat the same mistakes made by thier forefathers . Similarly , if students are only basing thier knowledge on facts they might not be in a position to invent new things and stick to the same old way of life . Hence looking at all these matters , I conclude that ideas , facts and concepts are equally imporant to students .
(GER,high) From my point of view this statement is only partially true . Through my studies in the area of management and entrepreneureship I know that the typical successful entrepreneur is not the crazy person many people think . Quite the opposite is actually the case . A successful entrepreneur thinks his ideas and plans through very carefully before acting . Even though it is of course true that there is always some risk involved , risk-taking should not be confused with carelessness . More over , I believe that a person who really knows where his or her strength lay , can be very successful . For example , if a person has a passion for and the ability to building guitars , it will probably be best to exploid and build on this ability , rather than try to build many different instruments . Specialization is the kye here . So , if someone is good at something and likes what he or she is doing , improving the skills in this area will be more successful that starting to experiment . This of course does not mean that a person , who focuses one his strengths , can stop learning . It only means that the energy for learning new ways and methods should be focused on that one particular area . For the guitar builder , for example , this would mean to every now and then try something new to improve his procedures . He could maybe invent a machine which helps him to be more efficient . Thereby he would be would try something new but the risk involved if the machine does not work is limited . Another way to try something new without carelessly taking risk is to transfer experience . A person who has gained expertise in a particular area might find a new and different way to use this knowledge . Using the same example , the guitar builder could for example begin a cooperation with a violine builder and exchange knowledge . The processes involved are similar but neither of them would have to actually start building the other instrument but both could still profit from the experiences . After all , I would rewrite the satement as follows : Successful people try new things but carefully estimate the risk involved .
(FRE,high) Nowadays , advertisement is a world-wide phenomenon that tends to pry even in our privacy . In my opinion , it seems obvious that most advertisements try to make products appear better than they really are . To begin with , we must not forget that business is business . Then , no matter how despicable the means are , the sole purpose is to make money . That is why ads always bludgeon the would-be customer into buying something . To do so , ads are expected to attract people 's attention at all costs . Moreover , advertisements often convey the picture of an ideal and perfect world . For instance , as far as the clothing industry is concerned , we all have seen ads showing sculptural bodies wearing marvellous garments ! Unfortunately , the average citizen does not look like the models so he or she feels quite frustrated . Giving a product a better appearance than its real one turns out to be an unwholesome way to convince the customer to buy something . To a certain extent , this phenomenon is linked to the kind of brainwashing people experience under totalitarian regimes , namely it tries to put everyone ine the same single mold without taking care of individuals . You have to be careful if you do not want to be influenced and this requires a great amount of self-control . One solution could lie in education : we should teach children how to have their own opinions in spite of what is shown to them . This could probably prevent such dangerous drifts ( if this kind of advertising was not so efficient it would have certainly been abandoned ! ) . Thus , we may affirm that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . By no means must we forget that the main purpose is to make profit so we would rather try not to be influenced . I think that it could be much better if enough safety nets were established but you know : every law has a loophole !
(ITA,medium) I do n't agree with the affermation . Today , the global popolation is cositituite of seven thousand of people and more people use the car . I think that in twenty years , the popolation will be augmentation and thus , people will have more cars . A medium family had today two or three cars and when the global popolation will be major , there will be three or four cars for family . However , I would say that African `` s popolation , or however all poor popolation , will have major rich and thus it can takes a new car . But exist also the problem of the petrolium . This resource is n't infinite and likely , among twenty years do n't will be others fossil combustible . Today , the people that study this problem think that it is important research a solution . A possible solution is take energy `` s Sun for develop a car that it going with the light of the Sun . An other solution is liquid hydrogen but it cost . There are other solution for to try at limited the problem of the petrolium . However , all this solution are realize also for the pollution , that it is a factor very important in the good life of the people . Among twenty years there is more pollution than today if we continue to use the car each day . Other scientist had propose of add more pubblic trasport , in way of to reduce the pollution . In twenty years there will be more car for this motives . Global popolation will have more rich and the popolation of the country more poor will be less weak .
(ITA,low) the cars today are very spread around the world like the most common way to move people from one point to another . I think and I hope that between twenty years the way to move evolving toward intelligent solution such as rinnovable energy . The cars generate pollution overall with consquence on the environment and the rosource are less than some yers ago the usefull of train , metro , tram could represent a solution to the problem of pollution and congestion but this type of vehicle must be more efficient than today . Morover if people use the private vehicle only for themselves one person the traffic became very congestioned while a better use of car for example go to work o to school with one car for many people can improve ours life . The rennovable energy such as sun and wind for cars reduced pollution or generate electricity . there is less air and sound pollution , I have a car but i use it if necessary i prefer do moving with my legs to little distances . The constuctor of cars work on new type of engine and space because the people understand this problems and try to buy car with this features . The resource is good to future for me .
(FRE,high) I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn fact , and I will take a controversary example , which is History . First , when you learn History , it is important to be able to give their relative importance to the different facts . For example , it is impossible to understand different facts of French political life , such as the Popular Front , without any idea of what the Left and the Right mean . Moreover , sometimes ideas happen to inform reality . It would be absurd to learn a factual history of the USSR or the history of the Cold War without any idea of what communism is . More profoundly , there is no discourse about facts without an interpretation of the facts . Nietzsche and , more recently , Michel Foucault have explained that all the facts are constructed . There are no `` natural facts '' that we should examine without a theory . Even the selection of the facts reveals an idea of what is important and what makes History . Economics provides us with countless examples of theories that are necessary to explain facts , and even to construct them . However , it does to mean that there is no escape to general relativism , and that there is no necessity to learn fact . It is important to cast light on the hypothesis that are made in Economics as well as in History , but it is also important to give some information about the facts . At the same time as they improve their critical view , students should be able to learn precise facts . To take another time the example of History , the chronology is very important : it would not make sense to explain the facism thinking that it occured before World War I. As far as Economics is concerned , it is important to test empirically economic theories to demonstrate that they are useful to understand real economic relations .
(TEL,high) Man has invented various modes of transport , right for very invention of the wheel , to move from one place to another . The want to reach his destination faster and easier has made him invent machines and roads that would serve his purpose . The car , an invention of the 19th century , has brought in a paradigm shift in the way he travels from one place to another . Today , a car has become a part of modern world that it would be difficult to imagine commuting to work or going on a holiday on your own with your family without a car . I for one would n't agree to the statement that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use that there are today . Though , almost all cars of today run on gasoline , which is a fast depleting resource , we have developed technology to aid us find oil reserves both in the deep seas as well as in the middle of the dessert . Also , some Japanese car manufactures like Honda has invented hybrid cars that run on alternate fuels like Hydrogen . These cars are known to be very eco-friendly and not emitting the polluting gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as in the case of internal combustible cars of today . Though hybrid cars are expensive being a very recent invention , over the years , these would be accessible to people at large at affordable prices . Thus , the problem of for oil & gas reserves would become less important . Moreover , due to the large number of cars , we do face other problems like noise pollution and heavy vehicular traffic in many international cities of the world . These problems are being addressed by building super highways for people to have a smoother ride to their offices and homes . In conclusion , with cars having become ubiqutous as of date , it would be difficult to imagine roads having less traffic . However , I do n't disagree that with well maintained , sophisticated public transport system and stringent state laws , vehicular traffic can be substantially reduced as in the city of Singapore keeping in considerations the above said problems of depleting oil reserves , increased air and noise pollution and heavy vehicular trafic in the cities and towns .
(KOR,low) I agree that to have broad knowlege of many academic is better than to specialize in one specific subject . I have two reason why I agree this opinion : the goal of education and feature of modern society . First of all , the goal of education makes a good person who is adapted the society . To make a good person , the school teaches many academic subjects . Because the person must study the many academic subjects , he would be adapted the society . For example , two high schools in Korea had another curiculums . The one had many academic subject in curiculum , and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum . Which high school 's students were succeeded ? Answer is the former . Also , the modern society wants to multipalyer who performs various tasks . As one might expected , to specilize in one specific skill is better than to have broad skill of various field . However , this society make a multiplayer . In my experience , I work my company which has many tasks . Because I do n't have no various academic knowledge , I can not promote the manger first time . It is commly belived that to specilize in specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . But , this opnion is not available nowadays . To know many things is allowed to victory the competitions .
(KOR,medium) In my opinion , traveling world with group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money . First of all , while they give you time to explore places , it 's a time very short time , so you miss out on lots of things that is necessary . Secondly , Crumped in a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just is n't a fun thing to do . Finally , some tour guides do n't even know what they are talking about , and do n't talk when they are suppose to , so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date . Let 's say that you went to an University of Harvard , and they have lots to see like the science center , and famous people who graduated in that place like Bill Gates . So the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place . So while you are looking at unnecessary things , time goes by , and you miss out on the importants things like the golden statue . Also if you do n't make it in time for the bus , they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute . Eventhough , you go to places with your family or friends , they have lots of other people in the bus who is traveling with you . You could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends . But some people do n't care , because they also have Tv 's in the bus to entertain you , but it only entertains me a bit . Then all you here is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you . You ca n't tell them to be quite , because they will point fingers at you and even curse you . The other things are that if you want to sleep , and lean back your chair a bit , they complain to you how unfortable it is which is very annoying . The Great Wall of China . It has lots of history and legens to it . Surely , people want to know about it , but the tour guide does n't even say a word about it , and even he talks aloud , he does n't know what he is saying . Well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that , but if you pick the wrong time and date , you must face the consequences . Therefor , i disagree with the statement . First of all , the tour guide do n't give you the right timing for you to explore place . Secondly , you barely know anybody in the bus except for people who came with you , and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus .
(TUR,medium) The development in technology has reached a point that , it is very difficult to predict what invetion will be done next . There are many technological inventions that people could not even imagine some years ago . I am completely comfortable to say that cars will be improved imaginary in twenty years ; on the other hand , the increase or decrease on use of cars will depend to the calling the developed machines cars or something else than car . In my opinion cars will decrease considerably on roads , because the nowadays researchers even start to test the flying cars which are independent from ground , furthermore ; these machines look like cars but transport people like planes . These machines will not use ground roads , for the reason that ; cities are settled and modifying roads are impossible at the moment and the only way to deal with the traffic jam which big cities have the transportation system will be in the sky such as planes . Today big cities have diffuculties on solving traffic problem , besides ; another solution is that , in order to solve this problem the machines that will be used to transport people will have more seats in it so that , it would transport as much as people that it can . By this type of machines transportation will become more easier and quicker . According to population growth on earth there will be more machines to transport people , this means that the need of transportation machines will increase so that it is obvious that there will be more needs for seat in the machines twenty years later . In conclusion , I am not sure that , the new machines that transports people by flying to their destination , is going to be called the term car or not , I thik
(ARA,medium) I strongly disagree with the statement , because learning the facts of the issue is realy a big deal . knowing the fact is very helpfull in all aspects , for example wheen you know the fact that your hand will get burned if you touch the fire you will stay away from it . and when you think of having an accident if drive after drinking too much alchool , you will not do that . so being aware of all the facts will deffinitly protect us from alo of dangers we are exposed to . The same thing applies for students as far as focusing on learning the real fact of the subjects , it will embark their thinking , and lead them into more and more progress on all levels , so once they accept the fact of any subject , it will be so easy to go on further and further with threir research . and i think that this is the way how all developement started , once you know the fact of the subject you are working on , it will direct your thinking correctly . for example knowing that ice melts into water when the temperature is above zero , made you keep it in the refrigerater if you are conducting a research experiment on it . As aconclusion i can say that learning facts is significantly an important issue , it is the base for all thinking on all aspecte of our life . it is somthing we cannot
(TEL,medium) I strongly agree that `` young people enjoy life more than than older people do '' for whole lot of reasons . First of all people at young age are not bothered about any responsibilities . They are free birds and they like to enjoy their life to fullest . For example right now I an doing my graduation and I am not at all bothered about anything , I enjoy a lot with my friends , go for parties , have get togethers , we watch lot of movies . I never think about future , I like to take the life as it comes . Whereas when I see my parents they are lot more concerned about different issues in life , like they are bothered about their life after retirement , or the burden of their kids . The next thing is people at young age try to be adventerous , innovative in their thoughts and ideas . They try out some thing or the other to keep their life intresting . They expect some kind of thrill in their life . Whereas the elder people doesnot want to try out new things and they prefer to spend a stable and peaceful life . People at young age are very healthy compared to the elder people . They are with full vigor . The health problems of elderly may keep them away from enjoying the life to the fullest . Like for example most of the elderly people may have problems with blood pressure or may have cardiac problems or may have arthritis or any kind of problem . So these people generally tend to keep their life in subtle way and try to avoid all the noises or try to live in peace and serenity . Finally the elder people may not be knowing the latest innovations because of which they may be deprived of enjoyment . Like for example my grandparents doesnot know how to use the computers and they are not intrested to know . So the enjoyment which I get while browsing the internet and knowing whole lot of things , which made my life easier can be defenitely compared to what my grandparents are missing . So for all these reasons I strongly believe that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
(HIN,medium) We all are familiar with the phrase ` Knowledge is power ' . Which is indeed a truth in itself as knowlege af any kind nerver lets you down when you are in a crunch situation . Therefore I agree that it is better to have knowledge of many subjects as its makes an individual intellectually sound and imparts in him the quality of decision making . It can be a good option to specialize in one specific subject if one is really interested in any reasearch activity but otherwise it should be diversed and should consists many interesting topics within his selected course and also have some general subjects like arts , ecology , biology etc . It helps individual to be more powerful in this competetive world . In order to survive in this world one should have a quality to adapt to any situation and that is only possible if he has a chance to navigate through the vast ocean of knowledge . I can give my own example . I had a subject in highschool name scoteer-motor cycle repairing . It was an optional subject which taught me some basics of how to service our bikes , how to maintain them . The advantage now I am having that I can service my own bike free of cost . It also helps me in keeoping by bike in good condition . So we can see that the subject which seemed to have no weightage in my acedemaics rather helped me in my future to save money , which is indeed a requirement of the time for me now . So we can conclude that no knowledge goes waste . Somewhere sometime in our life we may require to use the knowledge which was learnt just as a formality in the classrooms . So its better to be prepared for our life with vast knowledge from broad knowledge rather than having a approach of getting limited common-sense knowledge by learning specific subjects .
(GER,high) An often discussed problem in our times is the pollution of the environment caused by carbondioxide , which occured by the great number of cars used all over the world . So to have a look in our future a lot of well-known scientists try to answer this question for us : How would the situation change in the next 20 years ? Will there be fewer cars then now ? To discuss this in proper way , we first have to name some pros and cons underlining this theory . First of all to have a look at the negative site of this question . In 20 years the development of the tramsport system will not be far enough to reduce the number of cars used by people . Furthermore there are so many automotive companies which benefit from the profit made by the car industry and there are also thousands of jobs , so that the government cannot stop the trend of increasing numbers of cars , if they do n't want the unemplyment figurs to rise . On the other hand there are some facts supporting the idea of a future with fewer cars . On of them is the great number of giant projects like the `` Transrapid '' ( train ) , which show that a movement in an environment friendly way is possible . Another , more important fact is : `` We are running out of resources , like crude oil !! '' , which are important for the production of gasolin . If there is no fuel , nobody can use his car , and the secondary resources like electricity , etc. are not enough developed . But the most important , and at the same time worrying fact is , that our environment is badly polluted , which means that we have to face a time where the governments of our world have to react , not like the US , in person of G.W. Bush is behaving concerning the Kyoto Protocoll . There will be new laws introduced to our society , regulating the usage time of a car per person per day . Or for exemple the regulation that one family is only allowed to have one car . So to sum up , it will be hard to realize this wish , but with an optimized concept and the co-operation of all countries , a realistic chance exists .
(ARA,medium) Travelling is very important in our life , especially when you travell from place to new ones or another cultures or lands . Many kinds of travelling differ from one to another from group to another . I agree strongly with the openion to travel in group l led by tour guide for many reasons we can mention some of these reasons that i prefere to travell in group led by a tour guide : 1 - The tour guide is the person or agencey responsible for the group and guide them to the places depending on the scaduele , as the guide is always local or native agencey that plann the trip and be resbonsible for the group . 2 - The use of tour guide is much safer than to be alone or by yourself , especially at these days from some activities against the foreigners in different areas of the world . 3 - When one travell in group this give chance to know and have new friends , and discuss different topics especially about the history or political or as general . 4 - When you use tour guide and travel in group this avoid the person to be used by any one especially if you travel to another country or another lands you don , t know about it that much or behavouer of this places . 5 - It is more secure and safety , 6 - The tour guide has well educated persons and have knowledge about the history and able to give proper explanations to any question . 7-some groups can use one of the group as guide for the trip and many deal with some agencies to provide them with transportations and plane their trip . as general , i like always to travel in group , and i like this openion and support it strongly . when you be in group you have a lot good time either for fun or increase your knowledge . * I prefer the older people to travel and be guided by tourist agencies this will be much better bec always older need much help . * I n my experiences when i was young i used to travel in group also i used to camping and always have a leader to our trip , and this the best way to travel especially for tourist . ;
(KOR,medium) Some people may think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . However I disagree the statement for two reasons . First , individual traveling is more interesting . Scond , the tour guide is not always leads some good places . Let me explane in detail . To begin with , backpacking is more interesting in travel . It is obvious that group tour is convenient , but I ca n't do myself in that case . And I ca n't improve a sense of independance . Let 's take my experience for an example . When I was sophmore , I had planed to travel to easten-asia . That is the first trip to out of Korea , thus I was too confused everything such as making passport , reserving ticket and scheduling my trip to think the method using the traveling company . However I decided to do own my on . Finally I traveled to Thailand and gained valuable exprience . After that I can do it everything myself and improve a sense of self-help . In this sense a group tour is not the best wat to travel . Next , some bad tour guides leads commercial place to make money rather than good place . In the past , people does n't go travel to other contry through the travel company . Now , many peolple use tour-agency . Thus there are so many side-effects . Let 's take my friend experience for an example . He traveled to Baly with his wife for marrige tour . Likwwise other people , he used a tour guide in travel . First day , the guide leads beautiful place in baly and gives interesting mentions he prepard . However the second day , the guide leads the coupple to a treasure shop and silver shop and explansed that these goods are most popular in this country and persuading him to buy the good . So he disappointed greatly . this shows that the guide is always good . In conclusion , a tour guide is not the best way to travel for the reasons that
(SPA,low) It is a contradictory statement . First I agree because if a student learns ideas and concepts can take decisions . With an idea or concept a student can think about uses , aplications or simply examples of the topics from where it came . P.e. if you think on a different equipment that you can do with something cilinder ( the idea is the cilinder ) , you get aplications of it like you can do a drum , a tunnel , etc . Ideas and concepts can be used to priorize different subjects and to focus on a principal goal to be sucessfully , p.e. if you get different ideas of an electrical problem that you have on class , like motors no running you can think about solution to solve it and be sucess like check the breaker , test the current before the motor or some others . Sometimes is mixed the ideas and concepts get students to facts , and otherwise some facts , let students to get ideas and concepts . But second I have to disagree because when a student gets facts and learns from it , this knowledge let undertand what happen and can change the behavior of certainly act or activities , p.e. if you know that when you laugh in class disturb the class and the teacher is not feeling good with that behavior , and you are going to get your scores based on knowledge but also on certain appreciation of the teacher , you can modify it and do not laugh in so the teacher will be feel better with your presence and will be take it in consideration before put your scores . So this is a contradictory statement because for students both things are important to understand ideas and concepts in one hand but in the other to learn facts , and aplying all of this can get sucessfully .
(JPN,medium) There are many advertisement that is made for many things . Car , food , toys , companies and etc . Us regular people who watch these advertisement defenetly grabs our attention making us buy the product or use it . As my opinion I think products that are advertised do look better than what they really are for many reasons . Many food commercial makes the product look very tasty juicy and big . They also add special effects that makes it look even better . But truth is that its just an average food that people eat . Many fast food restraunt tries to attract as many costumer as possible inorder to sell more product as much as possible . In my experience I once went to a restraunt because the commerical looked very good . As soon as I get there the food looked totally different from the commercial and it did n't taste as good as I thought it would be by watching the ad . Secondly many adverstisements use celebrities . Many people are attracted to this because many will think if this celebrity is using this product it must be amazing . People tends to lured in to this trap . I also have an similar experience that I faced when I was a little boy . I loved to play baseball and my favorite baseball player was Mike Piazza . One day I saw a commercial about him using a bat . He says that this is the best bat that I 've ever used in mu life . I chose to buy this bat with out any doubt in my mind . But i find out that the quality of the bat was very bad . Lastly , many company use professional to advertise their product . Many professional advertisers use their words and exageration to catch the customers attention . Oxy-clean for example was an product that was said that it 'll get rid of every dirt and stains possible . On commerical they showed that it really do work . But after you try the product you 'll see that the product does not have the same outcome as on television . Most product are usually much better than it really is . Many company try to trick the customers by making exagerations and special effects on the commercials so people will buy their product . The truth is that its not as good as its on advertisements . As you can see I agree to the statement because of the reasons above
(KOR,medium) In my country , there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fishes instead give fishes . It says important of learing not only the fact but also the `` the way '' . But it highlight that the important of the way . Like this old say , I agree that student to understand ideas and concets is more important than to learn facts . First , If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions . For example , when I was middle school student , at first time of math class , I could n't understand what teacher said . But finally understood the way of solution , I could solve another math questions . Although that question was more difficult , I understood the way of solution so I could do it . If I could n't understnad , I could n't solve that question . Sesond , If student understand idea and concepts , they can imagine more idea nad concepts . I mean , for instance , when I was high school student , I learnd about poet . Most of people do n't like poet because of words . That words were difficult to understood except teacher . Teacher could understood all of words . That is why that is important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , I could n't understand because I did'nt have any idea . So I agree about that statement .
(CHI,low) I strongly agree with the given statement . I think we usually misleaded by some advertisements or commercials . There are many example for supporting my perspectives . First of all , componies always want to promot their product for maximize their profit . We can see many kinds of diet pill advertisements on magzine or commercials on telvesion . The advertisements always said the diet pill can really works dramatically , but after people buy and use it , they feel they have cheated . Because many componies just want a good marketing for their products . They do not really care customers , even overexaggrating their products . Additionally , the advertisement have to show advantages of the product , it will never said anything about disadvantages . We usually see some body-building machine on telvesion commercial . However , we also see many our friends bought a body-building machine , but did not really use it . They often realized that machine is too big or
(KOR,medium) In my opinion , being an specialist in specific subject is much more important than having a broad knowledge . That 's because Modern society wants specialist . At the previous time , such as 19 century , slight and broad information about all range of academic subject would make out efficient solution and perspective view of the problem . But the world has changed . We can get that kind of knowledge in internet , very easily . It 's not wealth anymore . So , having a normal knowledge about all over the academic subject can not makes you a needed person . When you were teenager , school ( or teacher ) teaches you all kind of subject such as English , Mathmatics , Biology , Art , etc . But when you get in to University , you have to choose your major and study deeply in that parts . Why the education programme is changed general things to specific thing ? University makes a leader not a just normal citizen . When you roll as a leader , you need a specialized knowledge about your major . The society goes to diversity , they need an specialist on several parts to solve complexe probleme . So the importance of specialist is emphrased . If you want to be a needed person , you have to study your own subject , and be specialist . That way will make you wealth people .
(SPA,medium) I disagree with the previous example because I do not consider one is option is better from the other . I believe that concepts or ideas are as much important as it is to learn facts . Of course there exists a different weight of this concepts depending on the field the person is studying , working on or leaving in . But in general I consider concepts give the knowledge about a certain topic and give the opportunity to the individual to form a personal point of view of something , then after the individual create his or her own perspective he or she could learn facts and later on review them and analized wich facts are in favor or against its individual perpective , and generate a conclusion on what posture should take ; change the personal perspective about something or keep it . Also it does not exist a theory that stablish what to learn first concepts or facts , it could be better for a person to fisrt have knowledge about some facts and then revise the concepts of the same topic . But for other people shoul be better to participate in the learning process in the opppossite way . As an example we can see people that did not have the opportunity to study but they can have a good performance on different kind of jobs , just by knowing first the facts and then review the theory to solve the problem . For examble a lot of mechanincs , specially in Mexico , does not has a formal study formation but they know where can be the solution to a certain problem and then get interested in knowing the concepts . In recent year the combination of both statements is becoming the best way to succeed in live . ust ask how many universities include in their programs a 50 % practical courses and 50 % theoretical courses . And look for jobs that ask for expirience and ahigh university degree .
(SPA,medium) Nowadays almost everybody can afford a car , something unimaginable a few decades ago . I ca n't now imagine a world without cars . I believe the use of cars will never decrease . Furthermore , I 'm sure there will be more cars in use each year thanks to the development and needs of society . There are several reasons to think so . To start with , we all know the convinience of using cars , such as having more freedom or determinig one 's sozial status . I will give an example to support that they can determine a sozial status . My neighbour has been earning for some years to buy a very expensive car . He 's not rich but he just bought this desirable car to make people think he is a very prosperous and rich person . Another argument is that technology is in constant change . Probably in twenty years cars will have such entice things that everybody will desire one . No matter how much expensive it may be , a lot of people will be affording all their lives to get the best one . A third reason is that economy is thriving all over the world , and more people will be able to buy a car in some years . I feel that those who nowadays use other means of transportation desire to have a car . From the arguments I have stated above it can be seen that in twenty years there will be as much cars as there are today , or even more . They provide us a lot of benefits such as making our lives easier and exiting .
(SPA,medium) While many people think that it is more important for student to undertand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , I think that a stronger case can be made by pointing out that learning about facts and real cases of life can give the student the opportinity to re-live togheter with the people invloved in those cases the situation which they went through . It is important to undertant well the concepts but nothing as study a real case . Learning cases method leads the students to a group of posible solutions and teaches them how those solutions affect the final result . However to get involved in the facts and real life cases , needs a previous preparation obtained not only by the well understanding of ideas related to the fact , but also by the study of all the material concerning the case . In many universities programs , the profesors make a well balance combination of both methods and they obtain very good results . First they prepare the ideas and material to be learned by the students and after they present the real fact . It permits the student to apply their recent acquired knoledge and give their best result in order to reach a solution . Not only the result gived by the student , but the final solution is then compared with what really happend . It allows students to know wich solution to the problem was right and wich one was wrong . A survey made by People Maganize by the end of the year 2002 , shown that the learn real facts methods had a better approach of the right solutions to a specific problem that had the traditional method of just understand the ideas without application . There also exists thoudands of studies that support this topic . For that reason I think that undertanding ideas alone without application in real life , is not much a good method as it is the applicability in already lived cases .
(KOR,high) There is an old saying , `` Do not judge a book by its cover '' . It is true and applies to everything and everywhere in the world . It is impossible to see what the content of the box is only by looking at a box unless a person has an uncanny ability to do so . A woman with luxurious clothes eating in an expensive restaurant might not be rich because she might have borrowed the clothes from her friend for a day and somebody else was paying for her food . Same as the advertisements . Since the purpose of the advertisement is to sell products , it is inevitable to describle products better than they really are . Every product is covered with some descriptions and pictures on it . In most cases , the pictures are not exactly same as the real content . For example , one day , I went to the store to buy something to eat . Every food looked great to me since I was hungry , and the pictures on the covers looked really delicious . I bought a bunch of instant food and tried one of them at home . I put frozen pasta in a microwave , and when I took it out from the microwave to eat , I was greatly disappointed and frustrated . Although the picture on its cover had big chunks of meats and creamy sauce on softly boiled noodles , the actual food looked totally different from the picuture . From this example , it can be concluded that it is necessary for food companies or advertisement companies to make advertisement with exaggreational expression or pictures to sell them . I bought the frozen pasta since its advertisement looked great . If there were two kinds of frozen pasta with two different covers with the frozen pasta and the other one with deliciously cooked pasta , what would people prefer to buy ?
(ITA,medium) I personally think that young people give a lot of time helping their communities , but we must specify the age of these young people because when I think about young people I include people from 18 to 30 years old . Lets think about all the volounters in their contry or in Africa , I really think that 's huge . In fact , if we see more closer all the association or organosation we would find a lot of young people helping the next , trying to give to the people who have very little the help they need . As well all the soldiers that go and beat to defend their contry are really honorable . I think that you really must have something in you that push you hardly to do those things because it is really difficult . We should be very altruist to go and fight with people who needs support . I 'd say that one of the beautiest quality for a person is the altruism , it is something really good for a men to have and use it . Moreover , we can think about all the great fight led by thew young people during the history and now , for examples the pacific fight of Martin Luther King or all the parade made by young people to stop the war in world . Eventhough not only young people helps the todays society Finally , even if a lot of young people are not helpful as other we should respect everyone for his business , because not everybody has the same quality .
(ITA,medium) I completely agree with the statement . I think that the only way to be successful is to fix a target and , once it has been achieved , to move it forward and try to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibilities to drop . Many people think that the fortune has a big role to the way of success and I agree with them but I also think that fortune kisses just few people . I also think that success has not to be , always , linked to the money : there are a lot of good examples of doctors who are , of course , success person , but they are not rich as a big manager or owner of a multinational company . I also do n't think that success people are better than not-success people : there are people that naturally tend to the success and others that judge their life good enough without any kind of success . It happens that not-success people are happier than the others . I think I 'm a person who is forced to tend to the success : I do n't want a normal life as a lot of my friends have . I 'm fighting every day , fixing targets , sometimes impossible to get , in order to be able one day to say : `` OK , that ' s enough for me '' . I absolutely do n't think to be better than the others , as I said before , but I feel inside something that pushes me forward every single day : it 's not a good sensation because there 's always something I have to do or to run for . After the University , I moved to China for work : it has been a big chance for meut a lot of my friends disagreed with my choise because China was too far and I did n't need to go there to have a job . The problem was that I did n't want a normal job and it 's exacty what success people want : they want to do something that is not common to other people in order to build a good career .
(TUR,high) In today 's academic world , one can see increased specification among different disciplines : even in the same discipline there are different subfields on which academicians focus . Although it is a great way to progress within one field , the disadvantages should also be considered before taking a stance on the issue of the benefits and drawbacks of specification in knowledge / Medical doctors can be used as metaphors while talking about the profundity of the knowledge . On the one hand , general health of a society depends on the general practitioners who can prevent diseases or give advice for healthy living to the public besides diagnosing and curing basic illnesses . On the other hand , the medical knowledge is extended to a degree that it is virtually impossible that one person could have all the information available on each and every problem which can occur within the human body . A specialist can come into the scene where a practitioner 's knowledge about a health issue is insufficient to cure an illness . Since a specialist is able to know more profoundly on a topic and has more time to be more up-to-date about an issue , he or she will be more help in solving the problem . It is important to keep in mind that generalists are as important as specialists . Since speciallists concentrate deeply on an issue by making extensive research in their area of expertise , they tend to forget to see the broader picture . On the contrary , generalists are able to see the broader picture more easily since they have more limited knowledge about a lot of things . Seeing from a broader perspective can help people to raise some questions about what is necessary and what is not in terms of scientific reaserch for example . It can be argued that inventions such as birth control pills are initiated by the general need for an effective mean to prevent unwanted pregnancies . As an invention which changed a lot of peoples ' lives in posotive terms would not be available if the progress was only depended on specialists who concentrate only one issue . It is clear that we live in a time where extensive knowledge is accumulated through the course of humanity . It is very different from the times that it was possible to be a Rennaissance man where Loenardo for example could make paintings and do designs and inventions at the same time . However , we still need people in academia who know a lot about the general course of the history as well as specialists who know deeply on a given topic . We need them both to progress .
(TUR,medium) One may argue that it is suitable to get broad knowkedge in many academic fields or just to specialize in one subject In my point of view it depends on your life expectation and where your plan to use your knowledge In academic world nowadays it is almost impossible to think the contrary of being specialiazed in your field that you are aming to Without the speciliazation how can the industrialization may occur All the technology we are using requires much sophisticated knowledge each days In addition to this it is very surprising to constate that the fields we specialized may become a general area of study because it may be divided into sub catagories There is no doubt that it is essential to have basic knowledge about the related fields For example engeneering in aviation does require a broad knowledge in jet engines metals air dynamics etc According to the field or your work you will choose you will be faced to have to broden your knowledge
(TEL,low) I would disgree with this statment having the broad knowledge of many acaemics subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because everyone would have their own choice of subject , so they prefer to be specialised in that particular subject . Notonly that many of the students would have grip over particular subject . It becomes difficult for the student to understand the unfamilier subject it would distracts them from their regular courses . For an example if we consider the undergraduated student who have undergone his studies practicular field of subject such as computersciences , communications etc . These undergraduted students who undergone specific courses would prefer to take specialisation in particular subject since they have know about the subject . If the student of computers would prefer to the broad knowledge about the electronics then that student face a problem because that would be the unfamilier subject , where he have to learn basics this would distracts him from his regular course . If we prefer to be specialised in the particular subject of our intertest then we could learn more about the subject i.e from basics to the recent developments . We would may much attention towards the subject and also shows much enthusiasm in that specific subject because it is the subject of our interest . Knowing everything about particular subject is better .
(GER,high) Young people nowadays tend to be less helpful to the community . I think there is quite a variety of reasons for that phenomen . Firstly , time nowadays is quite rare . There is a wide range of persons and institutions that require our time . From child to adult people have to do a lot of education and gain some practical experience . At the beginning of a lifetime parents and teachers want us to learn . Some years later job is requiring additional education . It seems as if education is always a main topic in a life . Nowadays things are getting faster and more is being expected . This prevents young people from investing time in projects that limit their own educational and spare time . Secondly , especially in cities live a lot of people . For inhabitants of cities it is not possible to know all or just a large part of them . But before people deside to help someone , they often want to know at least some details about who is going to have an advantage . As long as you do not know who is going to have an advantage , you need a lot more of encouragement . I made that experience as well when I was learning for my exam . I choose a quite room in Zurich to study . But I had to find out that a lot of people just do not care about others . Their first aim was to get their problem solved , which required a talk to other people . Furthermore , society nowadays does not really expect us to help community and therefore does not honor it if we do so . Finally , it can be said that a lot of people - as long as they do not get an immediate return on their help - are not ready for providing assistance in any form .
(ARA,high) I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their communities . We can see that in the increasing lack of staff in charity organisations and lack of volunteers in elderly homes and orphanages . However , there are three reasons that can justify why young people are n't available for such services as their counterparts had been thirty or fourty years ago . First of all , the educational requirement have increased on the average and hence the time required by young people to obtain the necessary qualifications . Thirty or forty years ago a diploma was good enough to practice medicine , have your own clinic or work in a hospital with a good salary . Nowadays you need much more than that , at least one Master degree and several researches as well as a membership of a well-known Medical body Like the Royal Assembly of British surgeons . The same applies to all levels of education required to perform certain jobs . Second comes the fact that education , and life in general , is becoming more and more costly . This forced many young people to go to work early in their lives to support themselves or even their families sometimes . In fact , most of college and post graduate students in some areas are part time students and part time workers . This has placed heavy pressure on the free time available for charity activities The situation becomes even worse if these young people decided to have families with one or two children . In this case the demand would be increased so much that some of them go home for only three to four hours to rest and spend the remaining hours working in more than one job or taking care of their children or studing , in case they were ambicious and persistent enough to do that . We now come to the third reason in my opinion which is entertainment . This can be subdevided into two subcategories . First is the little time left , if any , for relaxing and enjoying , after the previous two reasons I mentioned . In this case young people prefer to spend such time in having fun and enjoying themselves rather than engage in an activity that will help the society but be more depressing to them . The other subcategory is the abundance and diversification of entertainment means that did n't exist two or three decades ago . Such abundance and diversification is much more tempting to young people than working in an elderly house or decorating the streets . They can select between cinemas , clubs , different kinds of sports or musical parties . and all exist in each of their areas . Thiry years ago there would be only one or two means of entertainment and not working all the time even . That is the way I can interpret the increasing lack of interest by young people to help their communities .
(FRE,high) An advertisement is a publicity for an object , a restaurant or food . The company that makes it wants the people who watch the advertisement to go to that specific restaurant or buy that particular object . We will first discuss the principles of advertising and then we will explain our specific opinion about the statement . To begin with , an advertisement is made so that the company that offers the service or the good can sell more of it . Therefore , the general idea is to make , for example , the object seem necessary at home , the office or even in the car . To make it so attractive the producer needs to put forward its best qualities which will revolutionise your day to day lifestyle . For example , we can put ourselves in the situation where we need to advertise car perfumes . We will , in a first part , demonstrate that most cars have very bad smells and , then , that once the buyer purchased the car perfume these smells disappeared . The producer will try to limit the fact it might take some time for the perfume to act . But are these principles there to make products seem much better ? In my opinion , I truly believe that `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . '' Taking our last example , the fact that the producer limits , in the advertisement , the perfume 's action time is false information . The advertisement will necessarily show that the smell disappeared immediately after the man entered the car with the perfume . Of course , there are many examples of this . At Mcdonald 's , the Big Macs are nowhere near as perfect as in their commercials . In a general way , most people know that every object will not be exactly like in the commercials . The general population can make the difference between the ad and what the object will be like . Eventhough , they do make products seem better than they really are , the only thing that counts is that the difference between reality and the commercial is not extremely large . To conclude , our and our parents ' generations have been brought up with advertisements and with the companies ' will to lure more customers . Therefore , I believe that if some companies `` stretch '' the truth about their products , as long as it is not in the extremes , then their advertisements are still ethically correct .
(GER,medium) In my view young people enjoy life more but moreover in an other way . Three arguments are on my mind why I am able to sign this statement . In the first place young people do have much more free time . While young people are normally finished around 5ish with school , adults have to work longer . Furthermore young poeple have more holidays and are free on the weekends . My father has his own enterprise . Normally he returns home for dinner . But while he is still working , I watch TV or I play tennis with my brother . I guess sometimes he could use more free time so that he would be able to do such activities and just enjoy . That brings me to my next thought . Older people have more responsabilities than younger people . According to that , adults need to invest more time into complex things such as taxes or bills . My fathers company counts 300 workers . He is responsible for everyone . If you have to keep up with such a big responsability , your day can be stressy . Young people do not have to worry about that because they count on the help oh their parents . Finally young people have more energy to do activities . It is natural that a young body is fitter than an older one . The bones are still young and the body of a young person is still growing . When my mother an me go for a walk up the hill she is the first to make a break . My legs are younger and I am able to wlak longer distances because of my condition . In conclusion there are several reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do . The most important is that young people have more free time . In spite of that older people enjoy life too , but in an other way .
(FRE,medium) From my point of view , i would say traveling alone is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worry about anything else . traveling alone means , someone is able to go at there own pace , not worry about others , have a good time , meet others and have an alone time . Traveling alone is more relaxing , you have no stress , no on etells you what to do . It 's also a great experience . you learn on your own , it 's always good to have acknowledge other things . If you were to travel with a group led by a tour guide , it would probably not be a good idea , from my personal expereinces . i was to go once with my Class to a city called Jacmel in Port - au - Prince Haiti led by a tour guide . everyone wanted to do something different . People were getting aggrevated at the tour guide , because she was n't listening to what we wanted to do . But her job was to show us around , but she was talking more then showing . It was n't a great expereince . although , we actually did have a good time together my friends and I , because we were togther an das a class trip that 's what we wanted . fro all the class to go somewhere and saty together . Our goal was accomplished . From my own experiences , i disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . Maybe if I were to travel in a group it would have been different then with a tour guide , because you are to do what a tour guide does . And personally , i usually hate when someone tells me to do something , i get vexed . Traveling alone is a better idea , because of many reasons . When traveling alone , you do n't have any responsibilities , but only yourself , which is a huge burden of a shoulder . Experiencing , visiting , learning alone is great , no one bothers you and you do n't get annoyed , and I belive that is a great way to travel , with no stress , it 's all about having a good time , relaxing and having no worries .
(ITA,low) For me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this wey we can have more possibiliy to change my life . For example , I can specialized in one specific subject but the future can reserve me a lot af problems and so I can costrec to change my work and in this case it is very important have a big knowledge . In fact , for your private live , a broad knowledge is more valuable than a specialised one . A broad Knoweledge can halp you in a different situations , for example to try a new job . For this reson , we must study a lot of subjects and we must try to have a big knowledge for all and different situations . Whith a broad knowledge you can communicate with everyone about everything . So it is very important read many newspapers and a lot of books . But , it is important tell that in some case we can specialize in one specific subject . But , in these day there is a specialist for everythins and it is not to easy to find a topic to do research on . You have to knew everything about your topic and this is very difficult . At the and , i think that a broad knowledge is better for all the people and it is very important .
(ARA,high) I do n't agree with this statement . I think people can enjoy life no matter how old they are . I also think a person can feel miserable no matter they were young or old . The reason people enjoy life has nothing to do with there age but is caused by other external factors and circumstances . One factor that helps most people to enjoy life is being around the people they love . This means that an old lady could enjoy life by being around her grandchildren . It also means , that a young boy can feel miserable and unhappy when he is living away from his parents and friends . Another factor which causes people to enjoy life is health . People in good health usually enjoy life more than other sick people . This means , that an eighty years old man who is in an excellent health condition is most probably enjoying life more than a sick eight year old boy . Never the less , I believe that financial security help people to enjoy life . Richer people usually has more means to enjoy life than poorer people . This might sound shallow , but no one can deny that it is true . This means that a very old billionaire can enjoy his life as he can use his money to do fun activities like travel . At the same time , a young poor man may not be enjoying his life as he does'nt have the means to have any luxury . In the end , I would like to stress how I do n't think age affects how much people enjoy life . I think you can enjoy life wheather you were young or old ; however I believe there are other things which help some people enjoy life such as good health , money and being around the people you love .
(CHI,high) For old people , they have experienced all kinds of events , delightful or frustrating , so the life has already been a past process . In my opinion , what they should do is to review if and gain satisfactory from it instead of looking forward . I definitely agree with this statement and below I would explain some of the reasons . Every day , every hour , and even every minute , we , especially the young people , face a lot of problems either in work or at home . Since the world is rapidly changing and modern life has became more and more complicated , there are a lot of pressures , also can be called pleasures , modern people can enjoy . Obviously , old people can not catch this rapid social pace , it also implies that these great pleasure resulting from works or compete are more and more far away from the old people . Internet , invented in last century , with its wide availabity and increasingly prosperous information supplies , has become one of the most powerful means of both communication and pastimes today in the history , and will be more and more difficult to ignore . As it is so fashional that its user has been basically limited to the young people . Yong people has active thoughts and strong curiosities . These are essetial traits for enjoying the life . Take the case of a thing that one of my neighbor family , having both a teenager member and a grandfather . The boy are proficient in almost all kinds of modern facilities and seems to be obsessed with them . While the grandfather , with a priority to these machines , but seldom to touch them . The only entertaiment he enjoys was the boring radio . In brief , young people is just on the arising phase of their lifes , and it is the right time for them to enjoy the life which is still somewhat mysterious .
(CHI,high) When travelling in a group led by a tour guide , one person will feel convenient because the tour guide will arrange the routine and lodging , and can share happiness with different people in the group . However , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Firstly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will waste a lot of time on waiting for other people . I once had a trip in a group of 20 people . Before visiting a place , everyone was told to come back in one hour . I came back on time but stayed there for half hour just to wait for those who did n't return punctually . As a result , we had no time to visited another place which interested me . Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will based upon a fixed routine . The routine is arranged not according to the tourists ' interests , but according to the purpose of the travelling agent firm . So during the travelling , we will lose chances to explore new sites and routines , which are more attractive . Thirdly , travelling in a group led by a wrong tour guide will be a nightmare . If the tour guide just cares about money , he will always lead the tourists to some shops where the prices are extremely high . In this way , a lot of time will be wasted and a lot of money will be spent on the commodities which do not worth that much . On the other hand , the guide will earn commissions from the retailors by taking the tourists into the shops . For example , last year my friend spent USD 100 on a necklace on a travelling in a group led by a tour guide . But the same necklage can be bought at a price of USD 25 in another place .
(TEL,low) The concepts of learnig from facts is moor importent than understanding thing . practical observation is moor importent than theoritical knowledge . byexperiance we can learn moor . we can lean driving a car bu practicing not by understanding ideas how we can stsrt and how to use tha breaks etc. , not only in driving a care riding bycical . one of the most importent thing is how learn maths with ideas or else with facts . without understanding ideas we dont ge maths by practicing thigs that have more and more . By learning facts we understand the depth of maths . some time we can use tha ideas . for example in my school days my teacher gave one priblem to find out the area of our class room i know tha formula for thar but i dont know no how to use that one . After that my reacher lear to me how to calculate of our class room by taing its lenth and breath . finaly i thought that with only knowledge of ideas u dont find any use . when we are learning computer subject the manual give some information abouthe the computer and we can aderstand the basics of the computer . at that time we have less knowledge about that but we learn from practies this is the keyboard and this is the monitor otherwise we have some confussion about that . Thus we can undrestand the conceots of anything notonly driving acar , riding abycical , learning maths , and computers in our life everything is understood by facts or by practical .
(CHI,low) Will we success if we always make a decision through the old way ? In my opinions , this is a quit clealy answer . I believed that if we want to creative a really achivement , we have to make change that 's for sure . If someone wants to be successful , he or she must have the characters bellow : First of all , old things wo n't attract people . For instance , we wo n't buy another product for their same function or appear . We will purchase something because of its newest and fleshest nomatter in any aspects . In addition , ability in make a right decision is a key to success . The differents between the leader and members is determine alility . It is obvious to look their position in salary . Leader were the one got the high payment in a job . Finally , the most important character in successful people is a precisely foresee . This is the heart for a person who will earn the respect and acomplishment . Those people always saw the opportunities we will never see and seize this adventage to make a big profits and large benefit . To sum up , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Because they have the talents or abilities to convince people to join with them , make the right decision without pain as well , and saw the chances advence .
(HIN,high) I do believe that the young people enjoy life more than older people do because the young people have more time and energy to enjoy in a day as compared to the older people who work throughout the day mostly to make ends meet and hence are left with not much of a time and energy to enjoy at the end of the day . Being young you have lots of things to explore and look at as in school and then the college . All those different field trips and the social and cultural programs are just a few to mention when we say about how the young people enjoy more than the older people . For the older people , their jobs or businesses do not have such field trips or cultural programs to lighten up their spirits , as their schedule does not permit with all such things . A typical 9 to 5 job to takes up the time of the day doing pretty much the same job for years together . The older generation pays for the enjoyment of the younger generation . And literally , it is so , as the older people spent most of their lives making and building their assets , which is of course for the younger generations of theirs . So the young people spend on their parents money and do not have to worry about how they will get the money tommorow as they know they have a monthly or the daily allowance which is going to come their way anyways . As the older generations have more worries in thinking about their finances and budgets and their house hold requirement which the younger generation does not have to think of as it is been taken care of for them by the older people . So that again leaves them more time and energy to enjoy . So I feel that young people surely do enjoy more than the older people do .
(ARA,low) It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . My subject important is the stronomy . In fact , astronomy is very huge . there are a lotof galaxies . In each galaxy there are several stars . The sun is the sular system . The sun has nine planets . The planets are pulled into the sun by power of gravity . Astronomy is very big and larg that we can not recognize to easilly .
(ITA,high) Techniques of advertisement started to develop at the same time consumer began to spread in the world , and they improved a lot during the last century , especially as new media , like television , grow up . As I always did jobs related with marketing and commercial activities , I am very aware of the fact that many advertisements make products seem much better that they really can be . So , I will explain the reasons that this habit can have , and also the problems it can bring about . Firstly , I think that a company always needs to provide consumers with an amazing image of its product . As a result , an advertisement usually stresses on the better qualities of the product X , without naming any problem related with it . For example , when Ferrari , an Italian sports car manufacturer , launches a new car , it most likely create an advertisement showing the new car 's great speed , but it does not really points out that this car would consistently consume lots of fuel ! This negative factor probably does not even interest Ferrari 's typical customer , and the car is presented as it really is . On the other hand , while I think that usually advertisements present the real side of a product , I must admit that sometimes they are really excessive . When a product is made for a specific purpose , it should not be presented as something different , just in order to create a better impression in people 's mind . For example , many car manufacturers , like FIAT , another Italian firm , are used to create sports versions of their utility models , and they present them like sports cars . The problem is that they really are not sports cars , but only slightly more faster models of normal cars , so the image advertisements introduce is completely wrong . To draw a conclusion , I thinlk that it is really impossible to prevent advertisements to give the best image of products they can . Most of companies really offer the truth of their products , just omitting some negative aspects , but sometimes they really lie to consumers , by providing false images . However , I think that this is not such a common situations , and most of advertisements present products nearly as they are .
(FRE,high) I will support the idea that young people are more happy than older people . The first reason is that people in their twentys for example usually have less health problems and more energy . They are at their physical heights , strong , and beautifull ! They can go out late at night and wake up early the next day without feeling too much pain . Another reason is that young people still have hope . Hope in a brighter future for the world , hope in a brighter future for themselves . They beleive , and they are theoritically right , that everything is still possible in the world and in their life , and this contributes greatly to their happiness . Every day a new life can begin . As a counter example , I have a friend , 40 years old , who has been a technician for the twenty first years of his career , despite the fact that he didn n't really like technical jobs . He always thought his job was just for a living and that he would n't do that all his life . But recently , when he wanted to finally change job and work in business , he just could n't find a single employee that aws interested in his profile . He was very depressed about the idea of spending the rest of his life doing something he did n't really like . Whereas for young people , it is easier to change job . Finally , young people have less reponsibilities than older people , therefore they are less likely to suffer from stress than older people . Their job , their familly life , and their belongings are not as important as they will be in their future . Plus , their decisions usually involve only them , therfore increasing the satisfaction that they can get from life . They can more or less decide according to whatever they feel is good for them , without having to find a compromise with a loved one or childrens . For instance , if they do not have a family , they can decide to go and work abroad if they have a great opportunity , which is not so easy to do for someone that lives with his wife or husband . As a conclusion , even though there are many benefits to growing old , young people enjoy more life than older people . But after all , being young is in people 's minds !
(GER,medium) Traveling in a group can be a lot of fun . Normally those tours are well organized and you always have people around you . But visiting other places does not have to be less fun . Tours which you can do on your own might turn out to be more flexible . Traveling in a group guided by someone always means that you do not have to plan anything except maybe for planning the day when you will go to the traveling agency and it can be a lot cheaper when you compare it with travelling alone . Also you could miss important sights if you do not go for the tour guide . But there are many things that can make a journey without a tour guide and alone an unforgetable expierence . If you are alone you are administrating your own time and do not depende on other members of the group . You do not have to wait for them and you can leave out some sights that are not quite of your interrest . This can save you a lot of money . It is true that traveling in a group makes it sure that you have people from the first day of your holidays which whom you can comunicate , but to say when you are traveling alone makes you lonely is not true . There are many people traveling alone and they always find somebody to talk , play or simply to have fun with . Being on you own makes you flexible and independent . Being in a group guided tour has the advantage of letting you see all the famous sights and have a lower price maybe . In conclusion I want to say that I think it depends on the caracter of the person who travels . If you are open minden with a flexible carater and a long time of vacation days , weeks , month than you might prefer the alone tour but when you are a person who likes to have his group , a high porcentage of culture influence and not missing any of this then you might stick with guided group tours .
(ARA,high) It is rather impossible to generalize and state that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Therefore , I cant wholeheartedly agree with the aformentioned statement . Travel could be broken into multi categories that may include tourism , religious tourism , safaris and adventures , and business . The statement may work well for some kinds of travel but may unlikely be suitable for others . For example , honey mooners are not likely to be keen to travel within groups let alone having a tour guide with them most of the time since privacy is valuable and treasured by newly weds and even couples seeking to spend quality romantic times together . Conversly , traveling for religious reasons may underscore the importance of traveling in groups led by guides . To further clarrify this point , piligrimage is a rather complex practice that may require traveling within groups as required by certain regulations and needs . That becomes clear in Saudi Arabia , where piligrims cannot travel on their own to Mecca in the Hajj season ( piligrimage ) and they are required to travel in groups accompanied by tour guides who are more likely to be familiar with the Hajj practices and terrain . Additionally , people seeking adventures normally prefer to have their own itiniraries and most likley prefer to travel according to their own pace , plans , and preference . As an example , a tourist planning to climb mount Evarest will unlikely wish to stick to groups and share common itinrary . Managing cost may make travelling in groups more attractive especially that tour opperaters are capable to get attractive deals on larger groups . Accordigly , this situation raises the issue of tour guides to maximize quality time spent and ensure that the group is exposed to the largest number of attractions . In conclusion , the arguments presented above make it clear that it is almost impossible to generalize that it is , indeed , the best way to travel is in groups led by tour guides . It is unequivicolly clear that the characterestics of people and reasons for traveling are so variabely distinct and different which only makes it incumbent on me to diasgree with the aformentioned statement .
(HIN,high) Successful prople try new things and take risks and not just confining themselves to fields they already know . They do use their existing knowledge to try new things . Using their existing expertise they develop courage and bent of mind to look into new aspects and find out the new things . Successful people try new things . They look into other aspects and do not fear from looking deeper into that . Every body knew that apple falls towards earth but only Einstein aked the question `` WHY '' and dared to find out the reality . He didnt simply accept that things are like this . He investigated into this and today we have the explanation for many phenomena based on his theory only . Today we have many technological advancements going on . Many scientists are working on those findings . If these scientists had not taken the risk of exploring new things we would have been still in the same state as our ancestors . These scientists were successful as they tried new things and worked hard to find them . All the discoveries owe their allegiance to successful scientists who tried to find new things . Had the columbus not set on a sail to prove the earth is round he would not have discovered a new country . Success always favours those who take risks . Industrialisation is occuring at rapid pace . Persons setting them up are not neccessory technocrats . But they want to try new things and hence taking risks . Ideas are no one 's property . Every one can think new and work for them . But only those who beleive in them and work on them are successful . They work and gain the expertise slowly . The fear of being getting failed and not taking risks cannot bring success . If a child doesnot take the risk of running he will never become good athlete . All the successful businessmen are there as they tried new things that were later on accepted by the whole society . At the same time some may say that if a person works on what he knows he will be more successful . This is true to some extent but in the same field also he needs to think differenly and try new things . If a persn continues to work on what he knows , he will not be able to expand his horizon of knowledge . To gain perfection also he needs to try new things and take the risks . Thus it can be said that for success in any field whether known or not there is need to try new things nad take risks . The fear of being failure and not looking at new aspects can not bring success .
(ITA,medium) I agree with the statement bacause , according to me , the new technologies will allow people to improve the quality of public transport . Thanks to this travelling will be faster and will have less impact on the environment . Nowadays cities are full with cars and this is not just an environmental problem but olso an economical one . In my opinion tramcars and alternatives means should be preferred to couches because they need , to be supplied , energy and not with oil . Maybe in the future people will use their bicycles to move for short distances and trains or planes if they have to cover long distances . But it is only an idea . If the nowadays rate of smog keeps growing , as scientist warn , people will realise that we have gone too far an then we will use our cars only when we are obliged to do it . To make it feasible the government should give much more money to the transport sector so that people will use public transport as much as possible . This prblem is particularly evident in Italy where the public means of transport are dirty , always late and always full of people : in addiction to that , the ticket is too high if compared to the service provided . So I hope that in twenty time the sector of public transport will be better and that the number of cars will be reduced . One of the big issues of these years is that of oil and its price that is growing higher and higher , that is why I prefer walking or take my bicycle to go to the city center . This is a way to see the city from another point of view . In the past fifty years it has skyrocketed and people cannot afford it anymore : so something must change . Maybe that of mine is a too optimistic vision but I really hope that the most powerful men in the world will understand the gravity of the situation and react promoving alternatives means in to opposition car .
(CHI,high) Some people believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , while others believe that it is more important for students to learn facts . I maintain the opinion that both the ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are equally important in the study of a student . The ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are mutually benificial . On the one hand , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts faster and better . For example , if a student of psychology understands the concept of behavior modification , he/she will be able to learn the facts that associate with how a elimentary school child behaves in class and how this child changes his/her behaviors better and faster . Also , it is unlikely that this psychology student will forget these facts once he/she understands this concept . On the other hand , learning facts will provide students with evidences that support their understanding of ideas and concepts . In other words , ideas and concepts will be supported by the facts that students learn . For instance , a student of history will be more likely to understand the concept of Westward Movement when he/she remembers that conflicts between the white settlers and Indians , the spread of America 's land , and the social , political , and economic changes during that particular time period of history . The ability to understand ideas and concepts and the ability to learn facts are mutually dependent . A good student needs to both understand ideas and concepts and learn facts . A student who can only understand ideas and concept without learning the facts will find the ideas and concepts dry and boring without being able to explain events in the real world . The process of learning will thus become mechanical recitation of theories without knowing how they work in practical applications . A student who can only learn facts will find himself/herself lost in the plethora of facts without being able to make sense of the apparently unrelated facts . The process of learning will in turn become isolated parts that do not form a illstrative whole . Thus , any student who can only master one ability among the two will find himself/herself crippled in his/her studies , and it is unlikely that he/she will do well in hes/her studies in the academic area . In history , any great scientific and academic advancement is built upon the premises of both theoretical ideas and concepts and facts based on practical application of theories , and the successful combination of both results in so many instances of intellectual progress in history . Without either one of these two abilities , the world we live in and our perception of the world will be very limited . To sum up , it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts . A mastery of both abilities will enable students to witness greater achievements in their studies .
(TUR,medium) I agree that the person should focus on one specific subject . Basically I can summarise the process for success as `` find and dig it . '' Discussion might be related to what subject rather that how many subjects . Sometimes people are concern of money or reputation . Money is a demonstration of success and reputation is an elevation of social status . I agree that money and reputation are important . However , I also believe that if someone is loving what he is doing , ultimately he will receive what he planted . The person occupied business with more dedication , it will be blooming with many flowers . Those who reallly perform what they like they can show enduring dedication . Roumi once said that a person who stands in all gates can never stand in any gates truly but a person stands in one gate will stand in all gates . People who try to collect everything will end up with nothing . They will have many distracted ideas . His efforts were dispersing in many issues and his knowledge will be limited . He cannot deepen the subject and knows the details . However when a person specialized in one subject , he gets a perspective of analyzing the problems . Since he concentrates all his efforts in one field , he can become more creative . He will think of the subject all the time . Many people have a problem about timing . They criticize their mismanaging schedule . Therefore the time management concept was revealed as a part of business field . The time management is about work less and do more . How will we create this seemingly paradoxal case ? Well , while we are squezing our days in a few issues , we will become more productive . Every action will be complement each other rather that obstacle each other . So , I finally recommend to all mentors ( parents , friends , teachers ) to help kids to find the beloved subject and to encourage them to work hard .
(ITA,medium) I disagree whit the concept that young people enjoy life more than older people . I think that young people have a different way to live , to consider their own life than older people , but this way not necessarly is better . This depends particularly by the responsability of a person , the minds , and so by the style of life . Generally young people , boys or girls , live in a particular way , doing differents actions , having differents interests , so live in movement without long moments of pause . For example , I wake up the morning and I go to university where I study , in the afternoon I use my free time reading , listening music , visiting new places , and visiting art gallery . While in the evening I go with my friends to theater , cinema , pubs , or concerts . The old people , instead , live in a different way , because they pass their free time at home , in fact they don-t work , watching for example television , so they use their time in a slow way . For example I have a grand mother who stays at home during the day , she meets her friends at home and watchs television in the evening . In conclusion young people don-t enjoy life more than older people , but boys and girls have other ways to live .
(CHI,medium) In my opion , i agree that young people exactly enjot life more than older people do . Firstly , physical conditions . For the young , they have long lasting energy than the old . So , this objective factor makes the young to endure lots of fun but exciting facilities that old people ca n't not stand . Such as : roller coster , pirate ships . In addition to this , the old ca n't experience coloful night life that is most attractive to the young . Because of their aging , tensive dancing , alcohol and sound intensity even prohibit them form entering a club ! Thus , they do n't have power to enjoy exciting life even though they are willing to . Secondly , beacuse they are old , they may ragard themselves as a kind of people that have already experienced a lot of things . They will not be interested to enjoy life anymore , what they want is to have a peaceful and quite environment to live for the rest of their life . Thus , they may always lie on bed or being alone all the time , without crowd , where should the enjoyment come from ? Moreover , they may generate the fear or sorrow feeling of death instead of happiness . So , psychologically , the havelost the ability to enjoy a life ! However , the young wo n't consider about the future too much , their attitude would be to `` enjoy life as much as possible , beacuse i 'm still young and energetic , otherwise , it will be a waste of my awesom energy . So , they hang out with friends , play large varieties of activities crazily . Finally , the society merely provides enjoyment to the old . The old once again lose a source of happiness compared to the young . As we all know , there are uncountable clubs , amusement parks , shopping malls as along streets , but none of them are suitable for the old to enjoy . The lack of old people activity sites as infrustructures combines with reasons stated previously create this social factor that contributes the most significant reason for the old ca n't not enjoy life more than young people . This can be also attributes to the notion that people care less about the old than the young . The young are future , the old are remnants .
(CHI,medium) We do n't know why some people can success easily than others ? Many people may think because they are lucky or they have always had some people to help them . However , in my opinion , I do agree that successful people try new thing and take risks raher than only doing waht they already know how to do well . Because they are more creative and they know how to integrat their knowledge than others . First of all , creative people have more chances to be successed . If a person has a new useful idea to change old stuff , the person could have more chances to be successful . For ecxample , one of my friends , he has always had new ideas to open his new business and he can find out the new business that other people ca n't see . Even thought , there are many rsiks but he is willing to face this challenge and to get over it . What I mean is that if a person has a creative personality and understand where the rsiks are . This way a person will have more chances to be successful . Therefore , i would say creative and aware of risks will provide people more chances to be successful . Secondly , the ability to integrat our knowledge can help us success . In the case of my friend , he has studied in bussiness school . During the school time , he studied many different subjects such as accounting , fincial management or case study . Base on these skills , he knew how to combine his knowledge in order to find out the risks and creat new business . Hence , I would say the ability to integrat our knowledge is a basic skill to be successed . To sum up , many people wonder how can they be successful ? The problem is that we do n't integrat and use our knowledge , be more creative and be aware of the rsiks . However , in my believe , I would say these are important characteristics to be successful .
(SPA,low) Wheather in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than are today is a controversial matter . It has cost and benefits . In my own opinion I think that it will not ocur in the next twenty years . On the one hand , there is evidently that the poblation of the earth will increase in the next years . If now there are six thousend million of people wich most of them no have car , and knowing that the countries not develop are developing now ( like China , Brazil or India ) or will develop in the next ten years , the people of these countries will buy cars . In addittion , the developing countries there are two cars per family in now days , with the emigration the number of families are raising , so more cars . And I want to add that the tecnology is there to make the cars more confortable and with more security . On the other hand , cars pollute the enviorement and people are now more conciounsly in protect the Earth and the ozone . This could be affect in the market of the cars in the world because people is using and will use more and more public transport in order to protect the Earth . Also is important that the natural resources are been used in more cuantity for all the products ( plastic , fuel , natural gas , etc ) and the cars need combustible to work and now the natural resources are growing in use . To sum up , there are important the two ways . There are people in the two options and I are in the the option taht in the future
(TEL,high) I totally agree with the statement that having a knowledge on many subjects is better than specializing on one subject . The world now is growing fast and the diversity in all fields is maximizing . In such a new and modern world specializing in one subject can be challenging . Fields which have once been thought to be in isolation or independent are now requring support from other fields . This interdependency has given raise to more sophisticated companies which require people with a minimum knowledge in many important fields . This has a lot of applications . A multi national company ( MNC ) is the best example of a place which require people having knowledge in many fields . In an MNC there are various levels of work . Let us take an example of a Human Resource Manager . His work is to employ new people suitable to the firm , monitor the progress of projects and constantly deal with economic issues of his form . The above three tasks require aplication in various fiellds like to employ new people he must first basically understand the needs of his firm . This requires him to have a knowledge in the field of firm bussiness requirements . Next to monitor a project he should know the platform on which the project is being built . For this he needs to have some skill in the computer languages . Next to deal with the economic issues of the firm he must atleast know the basics of the laws of bussiness running . Thus a level-3 worker like a HR manager requires a knowledge on three totally diverse fields . If this is the case with a HR manager then we can easilly understand the requirements a CEO needs . Even scientists need a knowledge on many different fileds other than thier own subject . For example a physics scientist needs to know mathematics for calculation in physics . He needs to have grip on topics like trignometry , calculus etc which are essential for solving complex relationships in fields like dynamics , solid state physics etc . The computer which can be called as the new face of the world changed a lot of approaches in many fields . It is being used in fields like astronomy , physics chemistry in many ways like embedded systems . A space research scientist , launching a rocket needs to calculate the astronomical distance between the earth and the target . This if done with help of a cmputer needs him to understand how to use the system and other such complexities . E ven the present educational system seems to have accepted the need of having basic information in many fields . The schools of the presemt day have many subjects lke maths , science , social , languages etc . The students ought to take all these subjects atleast till a certain grade and then opt for subjects they are interested in . The courses in collges also have many subjects in the courses which they feel are needed . For example in engineering all the students also have common subjects in the area of computers , electronics etc . Thus in view of the new world i feel a knowledge in a many subjects is needed for achieving success . A specialization in a single area has no great use today .
(JPN,high) I agree with the statement which says that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Although there are some legal rules for advertisements to prevent it from being advertized with wrong information , there still are some problems . For example , when you were to do online shopping , you can easily find some products which are advertized completely different from they actually are . Once I bought a necklace online from a store in other country and when I received it , I was very surprised how different it was from what I thought from the website advertisement . I am sure that many other people must have experienced this kind of situation . I think this online shopping example clearly shows that many products are overly advertised to seem much better than actual product . When you do the online shopping , all you depend on is their advertisement and maybe its picture . Sometimes pictures show only the good angle of the product which attracts buyers . Even the advertisement on TV have the same problem sometimes . TV advertisements for food products are one of the example . Usually , when they advertise about their food products , they would not say the food does not taste good or they are ok to eat . They always have to show that the food product tastes very good . You see a advertisement of a food product and you expect it to taste good from the impression of the TV commercial but sometimes when you actually eat the food product , you think ' It does not taste as good as I thought !! ' . I think it shows the fact that those advertisement on TV makes the products seem much better than they are often times . It would not be an advertisement if it makes you an impression that the product is not good , but I think that they should at least not let the buyers to surprise a lot . They should either produce better products or not to advertise them at all .
(KOR,high) Is the best way to travel is going on a trip in a group led by a tour guide ? If you are asking my opinion , my answer would be No . I have experienced both travelling by myself and travelling with a tour guide , and , now , I will give you a couple of reasons why you should travel alone . First of all , when you travel by yourself , you will have all the freedom in the world during your travel . I am not talking about walking down the streets by yourself kind of freedom , what I am talking about is freedom to choose what to do , where to go , and what to eat , see , or experience . I am sure the tour guide will provide you an excellent tour course for you to enjoy with your group . However , tour course will be just that , the tour course . Hundreds , or maybe thousands of people may have already been to those places . Is that what you want ? Enjoying an experience that the rest of the world already know ? If I were you , I would love to go some places that no one has gone before , or the places that the locals enjoy , not the tourists enjoy . Maybe , you will be able to find and make a local friend while you are enjoying a meal that are popular amongst locals . Would that be possible if you were a member of a group who are follwoing the tail of the tour guide ? Also , how can you guarantee that you will be a member of a group consist of only nice and charming guys and girls ? You will be stuck with these people for a week or even for a month , what if some of them are just unpleasant people ? Let 's say you are sharing a room with one of your group members , what if he snores like thunder ? I am pretty sure that is not going to be a pleasant travelling moment . If you travel alone , you wo n't have to worry about any of that . Yes , you might feel lonely , you might need someone to depend on during your travel , but is n't that what the travel is all about ? If you did not want to feel lonely and be supported by your friends , you could have just stayed at your home ! People always look for easier and more comfortable ways to travel . I agree that group tour maybe less demanding and easier way to travel new places . However , think about what you actually want to acquire during your travel . Is it few fancy pictures of you with nice looking backgrounds ? Or , is it once in a lifetime experience that you will remember for the rest of your life ? If it is the later that you want , you need to travel by yourself , and experience it for yourself .
(FRE,high) In my point of view , to travel in a group led by a tour guide has two main advantages : - First , traveling as a group one has the opportunity to easily meet new people which I consider as part of the fun to travel . The experience that is shared combined with the proximity in which are kept the members of a traveling group will render the exchanges really easy among them . - Second , when one travels , by definition , he does not know what to see nor do in the place visited . A lot of people find it more convinient to take a tour guide rather than gathering this information from other sources such as internet or travel books . The tour guide is generaly a local that , according to his experience , knows depending on the amount of time his group has , which sites will interet it the most . Although those two arguments can be true , I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Even though it is of course more easy to meet people within a group you are traveling with , the interest of traveling is to discover the culture of the places visited . The best way to achive this is to travel alone and therefore be motivated to go and meet local people . Those personal exchanges teach a lot about a local culture and can create long lasting links between people . Also following a tour guide has more inconvinients than advantages . First , you can not choose what you want to see , this choice being taken by the tour guide . With the information now available there is multiple cheap sources that can let you decide what to see and do . Second , unfortunatly , even more in some foreign countries , the tourists are only considered as a possible source of money . Therefore , very often the guide will be partly paid by local buildings , shops , restaurants , ... to make you come to their place although they are of minor interest . In conclusion , I would recommand to travel alone without a tour guide .
(TUR,medium) I completely agree with this statement . I think it is very important for a human to make , to tery new things in their life . sometimes it may be very risky , but we do n't have another life , so will not lose anything with trying . Making changes is always good for us . This change can be a very big one or a small one . it is same in all fields of our lifes . let 's say that i am attending a research program . And i have an idea that may effect this research but i am not sure about it . if there is no another chance , i will to that thing , regarding the risks that a became face to . i may be successful or not . But if i at least try i will not loose anything . we have to encourage ourselfs to try new things . it is our lifes . no matter what other people say , for example some people look us like a crazy person , but i thing it is worth to try . if we do n't try new things we will stay where we are all of our life time . does it really enjoyable ? No , i do n't think so . i actually think taht doing the same things everyday take people 's all happiness . i think that the person who does n't afraid of taking risks is the successfull person wheter he/she succeeded or not . taking risks makes the most important changes in a person 's life . it 's like stay or go , do or not . even if we make a bad decision with taking a risk , if you are still alive after that , than nothing is over . you can start again where you left , but not taking the same risks . we can not just take a risk to prove our encourage . we take risks when we beleive that it might effect our life positively . so , taking risk and making new changes in our life is good , but in my opinion we have to think twice before making a decision
(HIN,high) I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I think this is a misconception arising due to the outdated views on how a community is defined and also the ways to help the community . The complaint seems to be that the youth are so self-indulgent and selfish in pursuing their own career goals and ambitions that they do not devote enough time to community . But we must recognize that the individual is the basic unit of society . So if the individual does something to improve his or her quality of life , the overall average quality of life of the community increarses . In turn such people also inspire other people to better their lives and start a progressive trend . It is a situation similar to say a scientist isolating himself from society to excel in his inventions , but then the fruits of innovation are shared by all . A more serious aspect of this complaint can be the supposed indifference of the youth towards their community . This complaint also has roots in how do we define the community traditionally . In today 's ever shrinking world where more and more people of different communities come together and work , the youth seem to be embracing a larger community , and their commitments to this emerging but broader community might seem to affect their contribution towards their local community . Again , I would argue that if the youth are working towards some greater common good then that is bound to benefit all in the long run . Another point I would like to make is that if the young people devote relatively more time towards their self development , they will be more stable and more capable of helping back the community . Basically they would be able to help the community ina better way and even in more impactful way . For example , many institutions benefit from the funds and projects that their alumni bring back to their alma-mater . The real problem can be when the young people are not doing something constructive and productive . We definitely need to guard against such apathy towards oneself and hence the society . But this malady does not restrict itself to young people only and hence it would be wrong to blame only the young for such behavior . In fact , I think that young people are more enthusiastic and less cynical than most of the older generation . In summary , I would assert that an individual is the basic unit of society . As long the individual is involved in something that is constructive or beneficial to at least the person himself , the overall community is bound to get the benefits sooner or later , not neccesarily in explicit terms but in more subtle and impactful ways .
(GER,high) This statement is , in my opinion , incorrect , since i do not belive that someone with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could compete on a specific subject with someone specialised on this subject . In today 's society a great field of experts , specialized into certain academic subjects , exists . So it will be hard for somebody with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects to be more effective in fulfilling his profession , than someone who specialized on this subject and is perfectly trained in his profession . Of course some basic knowledge of many academic subjects is neccessary in order to make connections between different fields of study and to spur developement and improvement of subjects . This occurs especially in sciences where for example calculus and physics are very closely related and could have never been developed as far as they have been without scientists having a good knowledge of both . But without specialization into one of these subjects , or even into subfields of these subjects , no more improvements could have been made at some point since it is not possible for the human brain to take and work with all the information that exists on the two fields of study today . So it is also not possible for anyone to gather broad knowledge of even more subjects . So i believe that nowadays it is even better to focus on one subject only , but therefore to study it as perfectly as possible and then form research groups with other experts in other specific subjects in order to develope new inventions , then to try and cope with all the existing information and to accquire a broad knowledge of many accademic subjects .
(JPN,low) I agree with the topic beecause they dont care about it . They care about only themselves . It cause them not to help their communities . I think they had better be interested in something around them . There are only one reason about this problem . This is that young people have to think about their future and they think they can do anything in their future but it 's impossible for them to do this . They cannot do anything without their communities but they ignore this fact no maybe they dont just wanna think about it . So I think they cannot give them their communities . If they can notice about it they will make our society increasing and improve their skilles . I hope so that . and many young people think their future are blighting and they have many wish but they cannot succeed these .
(SPA,high) In the world today , it is definetly much better to have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject without having the knowledge of the other subjects . However , it should be a priority in life to have both . As people learn about the various subjects , they can conclude which subject is to their most interest and that subject will be the one in which that person will specialize in the future . For one , as a cultural purpose it is important to have the knowledge that the world offers . If someone is a Doctor for example , and they do n't know about the world of politics , or about history , about writing , music , etc , than they will be considered ignorant . It is essential to be able to flow in a conversation with different types of people . In the case of a Doctor who is from the United Staes , if he/she is having a conversation with a Doctor from Bolivia , than it is important for him/her to know about the country 's history , political status , culture or issues . If this Doctor meets with an artist , than he/she should know about the arts in order to flow in that conversation . Another example could be a student . If a student wants to be a journalist , that person must have the broad knowledge about all academic subjects in order to be able to write about each different topic . Also in a college interview or in a job interview , you never know what they are going to ask you . It is extremely important for a person to be highly aware about everything in the world . Everything is connected . Even for the future , when one has retired from their specialized job they will have for the rest of their lives , the knowledge and the experience of the many academic subjects that enrich the world . When they say `` you only have one life , so live it '' , this quote applies to gaining this enrichment of the knowledge that a human being can aquire .
(JPN,medium) Studying various kinds of academic subject is more neccessary for students than studying a particular subject . Of course , after learning various subjects for 1 or 2 years , students need to study one subject that they specialized in . However studying widely is critical for all of the college students . In universities , there are many faculties , such as literature , science , engineering , and medicine . They seem to have nothing to do with each other . However different points of view will be useful and effective when you are studying a subject that you chose , because nowadays there are many integrated diciplines in many areas of reserches . For instance , some part of engineering is now getting larger and it covers some part of medicine or science . When you want to be a resercher , I recommend you to learn a lot of subjects in order to have a various viewpoints . Another important reason is that if you study other subjects now , you will not get a chance to study them . After you became a senior student , you might be so busy that you cannot do anythig except the work you have to do . That is , because there are only a few chances to study many subjects , you should study different subjects . Some subjects are sometimes concidered , when we discuss today 's problems . For example , literature is important for all of us . It is an essencial tool that is used compare our own culture to another culture . Due to increacing globalization , we should know much about other cultures . In that case , we can use the knoledge of literature . It is dfficult and hard to study many things in your college . If you think so , you should think advantages of studying various subjects . You have to look at your life from the long-term point of view . Learning sometimes makes you in trouble , but if you overcome it , you can get better and better . That 's why I agree with the idea that students should study various kinds of subjects .
(TUR,medium) An advertisement is the most important subject for selling products . If the advertisement of your product is very good and interesting than no matter how it seems because the people will keep on buying your product . I think that the advertisement has to be perfect so that you can sell your product with a good price . Nowadays , people like to buy things which everyone has . No matter how they advertise it . If the product is not the same as they advertise than there is only one possibility is that , you will not buy it never again . Producers make good products . The problem is costumers . If they ca n't advertise it very interesting and amazing however the people will not buy your product . They will buy the ones which sounds interesting and after if they do n't like it , you will have the change to sell your product . As an example , you are producing bags . The quality of the bag is very cheap and bad . Paris Hilton wore it for advertisement one day . There is another company which has the same price and with a good quality . Would you buy the one which Paris Hilton wears or the one you have n't seen anybody wearing it ? The answer will be the one which Paris Hilton wore and bad quality . Why ? Because the advertisement is better than the other one and people never heard about your company . Last but not least , everybody likes to buy good products but especially the one which is good advertised and look expensive and usefull . If they are not happy with your product , than you ca n't sell anything to them anymore .
(ARA,medium) Firstly , I disagree with this statement . As a part of advancing the technology it has been also known to be associated with cost effectiveness . The technologies might help in giving more chances to live modern and fansy life but does not reach to ignore the current transportation ways . In the recent past the discovey of using the space ships was a great evolution but still yet the cost and the risk of using such technolgoies are preventing even developed countries to have these modern technology . In scientific terms , we can say that consuming of petrolume might be less than what is on today but the number of the cars might be even increase . Relatively , the world population is increasing on daily basis thus represent the demands for more land transporter ( e.g. cars , trains ... etc . ) . Using of the new technologies might help in accompany the new civilization to live in a fansy life but the cost effectiveness must be put in consideration . Undergoing the process of cosuming petrolume products on our daily activites this might help to develope a futurestic plan to maintain our daily usage which might be reflected on the number of the cars in the future . Alternatively , the land transportation ways will also bieng required as a part of our daily use and as of their cheaper cost in compare to the other fansy transporation ways ; for example , space ship , aircrafts , superjets . Finally , I would say that as the population is increasing the demands of people to use different facilities and transportation is also increasing and it has been reported that the wide of highways and roads is taking place nowadays all over the world even with the presence of different modern technologies ( e.g. trains , airplanes , ships ... etc . ) . It is not even stricted on third world countries but even in the big developed countries .
(JPN,high) I have a father who works very hard . He is a manager of a group of Japanese people at a company called Hitachi . Sometimes my father works so hard that he works at his company until the next morning . I feel bad for him sometimes . One day , I asked him about how he managed to do all the hard work . In Japanese , he said that he enjoys the work that he does and he said that the work that he does is very hard work , but he feels rewarded when he finishes the work because he gets a bonus when he does an extra hard work . I work very hard too . I go to a very demanding American School with high standards . I work hard to keep up my grades in my AP Environmental Science , AP Calculus and AP Statistics classes . During the time off when I have free time , I work on my homework . During the weekend , I work on my homework . I am under a lot of stress and pressure . I turned my college applications in last week . I am worried that I might not get accepted into the colleges that I intend to get in . FYI , the colleges that I applied to last week was in America . My parents also gave me an option to apply to Japanese universities but I cannot apply to them until I get the result from the American universities because the year starts different for American and Japanese Universities . To be honest , I do not know which country to go to . In addition , I have a choice of rejecting the University in America and instead apply to a University in Japan or I can go to a University in America . Either way , I do not know which country to choose between Japan and America . The Universities in America that I applied to will give me the results of whether I am a good candidate or not in April . Moreover I have three months until I can decide whether I will go to America or not , but I have not a clue about which country to choose because I love both countries . ( I can not stay in England because of financial problems ) Considering that young people are people younger than a college student like me and older people are people who are older than a high school senior , I think older people enjoy life more than young people . Young people are under enormous pressure because of the issue with the University and the future after that . On the other hand , older people do not have to endure with that pressure because they have already gone over that obstacle .
(TUR,high) It would not be incorrenct to suggest that people enjoy their live when they are younger . Provided almost every elderly people somehow complain about their current conditions and remember the ` old nice days ' with a pleasent smile on their faces , one may easily consider that there is more joy in being young . People have always been interested in finding ways of staying young . Many stories have been told about legendary fountains of life , secret formulas of miracleous drinks that prevents aging in almost every society . How cruel may a person become is descibed in some sagas in search of eternity . Therefore , youngness has become an equal term to beauty in our modern lives . However , it is not only about appearence . Presumably , humanbeing has the most beautiful stature when he is young . On the other hand , there are some other factors that make it more appealing . First of all , young people are indisputably healtier than the elder ones . This simply make life much enjoyable . How many of us have ever heart of someone with sickness and a sheer enjoynment on his face at the same time ? Besides , young people have much time to devote recreational activities . Concerns of a full-time employee or a parent are usually far from their minds . Thus , they can spare more happy moment with their friends , families or other people they hold dear . Even during their education , the curricula are desingned to ensure that they will learn with minimum level of boredome . In conclusion , life may not be alvays fair for an elder person . The more responsibiulity brings the more matters of concern . That is what aging provides . And we have nothing to stop that but being with people whom we love instead of spending our fortune on cosmetics , beauty spas and anti-aging therapists .
(GER,high) Cars are very important for our society . It ensures our mobility which becomes more and more important in these days . So cars became an important part of our world . But how will the situation be in twenty years ? In many countries in Africa or South America , often called the Third World , cars are not as important as in Europe or as in the United States . But in the last years more and more people get cars becuase they become more important . The number of cars increases every year and even the increasing rate becomes higher . So there is no end in sight . It is certain that in the Third World will be much more cars than today . But what is the situation in the so called `` Western World '' ? Fifty years ago cars were luxus . But today a car bellongs to life standard . Only few families have no car and the production of cheap small cars like the Smart enforce the development to have more than one car . So also in the Western World the number of cars increases . But it is on a high level , so perhaps the growth will stop in a few years . But there are no signs that the situation will turn to fewer cars . Less visible , but nonetheless important is the situation of the streets . All over the world streets become better and better . This leads to a more comfortable feeling in your car what finally leads to more cars . But I think the crucial question is not how many cars we can count per person . The question is how many people will live on the world in twenty years . At the moment the population grows very fast . During the last twenty years the population increased of about 70 % . It is not certain if the growth remain as high but sure is : population will grow ! And more people buy more cars . As a result I ca n't agree with the statement . I think there are no doubts that the number of cars will become much higher .
(ARA,medium) Young People And The Community I think that I would have to agree with this statement , according to nowdays young people dont help or participate enough in thier own communities , and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy life . Becasue nowdays a lot of young people ca n't even afford to loose time on playing or engaging in any kind of fun activities , Because they barely can make it from home to college and from college to thier part time work ( if they have one ) and then going home again to do thier chors and finish studying and doing thier homeworks , which takes a lot fo them dropping them beat on the bed at the end of the day . But then again this does not apply on every young person , some people chose not participate in thier own communities because they dont think that the community itself is not doing a good job maintaining things at hand , and so they dont want to interfere with the bumpy roads ahead . But also there is a quite fair amount of young people with plenty of free time who would love to help thier communities to prosper and to feel good about them selves as indivisuals in doing so , and not to forget that working pro bono for the community means no money , and not mnay people who would want to waste thier time and not get paid in the end , so sticking to thier jobs is the better answer fo their time . So in conclusion , I do agree with the statment that young people dont give enough time to help thier own communities , but in the same time I dissagree that should help the community and give thier time and efforts away on the count of their futures , but this doesnt emply on those young people who dont think and give much time about thier future or their community because they should , after all our community is what we have and what we stand for .
(KOR,medium) I agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not care much about their communities . The change of how people think is the major reason for this problem . First of all , many youngsters nowadays spend much of their time doing their own things , therefore they do not have time to think about their surroundings . For example , many young people want money , so they spend a lot of time on doing jobs . So , they leave home early , and they come back home late . Moreover , young people today are becoming extremely lazy . They would rather do something which they can be satisfied in the short-term , rather than the long-term . There are many homes today with television and computers , so young people stay in their homes reffering to watch television than help their communities . These new technologies keep the young people in their homes . Finally , the new generation of people are selfish . They would not volunteer to do anything if they do not recieve something . Even at schools , a child would not help teachers move books unless they get a candy . A young teenager would not do chores if he does not get an allowance . Overall , young men and women today must be satisfied with themselves before thinking of others . It will take a fortune to be satisfied with oneself , so eventually , young people will end up doing nothing to help their communities .
(HIN,medium) I disagree with the statement . An elaborate analysis of the reasons in favour of and against the notion would clarify my stand and help us develop a better understanding of the concept . Some would say that the young generation is money oriented and is involved in selfish deeds . But the point to be considererd here is that these money oriented youngsters contribute to the formation of a strong world economic backbone . Hence , every moment spend in earning money is in itself a contribution towards the upliftment of their communities . Youngsters do not look at the world like a divided place with boundaries and categories of communities . Tied up with the string of globalisation they all feel united and responsible to their single world global community . They serve in every fields of life and hence ensure a global upliftment of the human race . They are there in development of new technologies in the various fields like medication , communication , etc . Along with contributing indirecttly towards their community they also face thei responsibilities directly . They perform vital roles in representing their communities politically . The special needs of each community is explained by its representative properly . Moreover they are there in the entertainment industry , hence representing their respeftive communities before the entire world and help them being a part of the global happy family . The idea of globalisation is so ingratiated into the comming genereations that they are ready to shed all the differences of color cast race etc and come united under the shade of love for each other . Hence keeping in mind that the revolutionay idea of globlisation has changed the world I stick to my stand
(SPA,medium) I agree with the statement porpoused in wich is stablished that for students it is more important to undertand ideas and concepts than learning facts . I do have to be clear saying that facts are not as important as concepts and ideas are , but fatcs are not secundary thing without impotance they are really importat in any learning process . I say this because I am student and I can now be sure that when a teacher begins explaining facts without a theory before that includes different concepts and ideas , the class is really a lack of time , because students maybe understand the facts but do not really learn the theory that it is behind of it . Althouht it is also inconvinient for learning , when whe as students only recive concepts and ideas but no facts or examples that explains what the teacher is trying to explain , because in this way possibly we learn a teory but we wo n't be capables of ussing it . A clear example of this matter it is when you try by yourself to read a law , for sure will be very difficult to understand what is regulating , but when a teacher gives you some facts it is much clear and you really understand what is that law trying to regulate . Finally I do have to accept that when a teacher uses facts that really ecourage students . So I think I is clrear that concepts are very important but thet sholud be accompai
(TEL,high) Learning is an important phase in everyones life . Some students concentrate more on understanding ideas and concepts while some concentrates to learn facts . In my opinion both must go parallel in order to have an effective learning process . They has to be content about the facts and then they has to understand them by learning concepts . Mere reading of facts can not give a detailed explanation about the overall concept . Some practical knowledge is required to exploit the situation . Most of the students learn concepts by reading the textbook . Some concepts may not be understandable when we read them . We have to do some experiments regarding them , these creates some new and innovative ideas in the minds of children . For example , let us take lightening as an example . When chindren learn about the process of lightening thay are not fully satisfied about the process . But when they see the process through eyes they can realise that light travels faster than sound . That is the reason why we first see the light and then hear the sound . So by this example it is clear that students should understand ideas and concepts than mere learning facts from the textbook . In my school days my teachers would always insist to know about the concept behind a fact . Teacher plays an impotant role in this process . They has to create some prototypes which explains the concept about the fact . Moreover the student absorbs the fact when it is stated practically because students learn more from doing than from reading . But it is equally important to read about the facts because they must have the minimum capability to understand the idea of what teacher is going to explain . Once they are ready with the facts and concepts they can face any problem easily . Moreover this type of learning instigates zeal to exploit new things and this will definitely help them in the future education also . So in conclusion i would like to state that the process of learning must be balanced enough to have a better understanding of the facts supported by learning the concepts behind the facts .
(JPN,high) Students in schools take their courses with either their choice or what they were preffered to take . High schoolers are required to take general classes and students in colleges narrows down their subject to their major subject . Even though students will be deciding their major , they should have knowledge from several academic subjects . At first , students are supposed to take courses accourding to their interests . Taking courses of what they are intersted in make them work harder and it will keep the students ' motivation for studying . Even though they are choosing from their interests , their knowledge still should not be based only on one specific subject . As the students study only from one subject , their knowledge will be narrowed down . Even though it is possible , it is hard to live the world and live in this society as one worker with only knowledge from specified subject . Getting knowledge from many academic subjects will build the basic knowledge for the students to go out to the society and work . Without broad knowledge , people could often mislead their ways and decisions . Even if the students learn from specific subject , they need to have broad knowledge . Their knowledge from other subjects will help them to learn more for their major subject because there are always connections between each subjects or basic thought in the subjects . Nowadays , it is hard to live in the society only with knowledge from one specific subject . The students will not know if their one specific subject is right for them or it really interests them . It can be hard to change their ways without having any broad knowledge afterwards . No one knows if their one specific specialized subject will support the students through whole life . Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be life support even in their jobs . For example , becoming a business man will not be accomplished only with studying marketing . As they survive in the business world , they need accounting , various languages , and psychology . These three subject will support the business man fully . To have broad knowledge from many academic subjects , people will have less trouble and more fun to live their life through . People will need basic knowledge because everything is connected in the modern society .
(CHI,medium) Some people considered that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I disagree with the sataements . Although it seems to be a sound satement , but I think it is a sweeping generalization by the following reasons . First of all , we should focus the problems only on young people . By the accelerating of the modern city life , speed makes us hard to know about people living in the samecommunity with us . Young people may have responsibilities to help their communities , but we should not only asked them to do it . All the people in the same communities should try to help it . Secondly , how many time should we ask them to pay for these communities ? More time spending means more improvment of thse communities ? Today we can do some contributions to our communites services though internet . Maybe we should try to set a system that can work on the area of communities services in tweenty four hours . Finally , the difinition of commmunities are much unclear . There are a lot of virtual communities in the world of internet . Do they help people ? Yes , they did held peolple . We should not ristrict the ranges of helping the scieoty . May be it is better to let different groups help each other . In conclution , I fully disagree the satement that young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their communities , and thses are the reasons why .
(TUR,medium) I completely agree with that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subcject . I have allways been someone who interests into on several academic subjects such as politics , astronomy , byology and phsycology . It was not possible in my unioversity to study all of these subjects art the same time therefore , i choosed the politics as a major . I believe in that i would be able to be quite succesfull on all of them at the same time . Choose of major at univ. depends on persons individual interests besides other less influental reasons . However , it can not be restricted by only one subject . A person can be succesfull on several subjects rather than one spesific one , such as most of the scientist in history . Da Vinci was not only a paint but also an inventor of his age . On both of these fields his succes can not be ignored . Specialize in only one spesific sucject allways sounds me boring . Sometimes working on a person having phsycologic problems can be more enjoyable than study a physical promblem . Likewise , study for politics can be boring than working on a person 's phsycological problem . Therefore it can be said that we can rest while working on a different subject than the subject we had to work on much . Business life in my country doesnt shape with the science indeed . You can be a good Phsycs resarcher but that doesnt help you to make your life easily . In order to earn money knowledge on several subjects is more useful , especially in my country . Thats why most of the students tries to make MBA in all around the world besides their own major . Consequently it can be said that knowldge of several academic subject is definetely better than specialize on only one specific subject . Even though many other of the reasons to work on several subjects can be added so , only three of them described above . We can gain more benefits with the broad knowledge on many subjects rather than one academic subject .
(KOR,medium) Many young people enjoy their life , but not every one enjoys it . Many people fails their life and does not enjoy their life . The happyness of life depends on what have the people done in their life to be happy and weather the people satisfied with the result . The statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do can not be true at all of the situations . Most of the people has bad thing happens in their life . It could happen in any stage of the life . Some people has more than one bad memory which cause to a load of distress and depression . Many teenager has great amount of stresses caused by an academic , and sococial problem . Many teenager gets too much stresses and sometime , those stresses leads to a suicide . On the other hand , the old people , who retired or almost in time to retire has nothing to worry about , but their health . Worry is one of the boggest cause of diseases . the body does not function well when people worry too much . Old people has not a lot to worry about . But the Old people has higher percentage of being hurt , or die . Dying isn'y really bad if the person did everything they have wanted to do and if they are satisfied about their life , but not everyone satisfy about their life like stated in beginning of this essay . People wants something more at all the time . Youngsters wants to become and adult , older people regret about their life back in the past and wants to live their life again . Someone might like being old better than beign young . Not every body enjoys being young neither old . not every young people enjoys their life then an old people .
(ARA,high) It is realy difficult to say broadly that it is the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide , or to plan for your tour yourself . There are several factors contributing in making an opinion . If I am travelling to a new place that I did not visit before and have no experience or knowledge about its best places , timing , sight tours , historical places and recreational locations , then , of course , having it professionally arranged by a tourism company and being led by a guide will be the best option . This will save time and effort and in the same time will provide the best to see and to do in the place I am visiting . The trip will be professionally preplanned and I do n't have to worry about transportation or gathering information or going into the hassle of the unknown or unexpected . Another good point is being a member in a tour group will give me an excellent opportunity to get in touch with other people from different backgrounds and be acquainted with other cultures . It is a golden chance to make new friendship relations and enjoy talking to people out of the usual circle of persons in my ordinary daily life . On the other hand , if I am travelling with my family or with a group of close friends and I know the place or country I am addressing , then I would prefer to go on my own in such trip . Having visited that place , probably more than one time , means that I have the sufficient experience and knowledge as regards where to go , what to see or visit , and when to do this or that in the proposed program . In this case I may be the personal guide to my companions ! I do prefer this last option in case I am travelling with my family to a place I know very well . It saves me money and gives me and my familiy the advantage of flexibility in planning and in keeping privacy . It also gives us the opportunity to strengthen or family bonds and enriches our relation to each other without being tied or perplexed with obligations to the rest of the tour group .
(TEL,medium) Most people love to travel to different places . the question here is whether we have to go alone by ourselves or to go by a group that will led by a tour guide . my opinion is to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i agree to this and i will explain you about my opinion . First if you think you are going by yourselves . you only planned the trip . your hotel bookings everything was done through internet . even though you listed the visiting sites from the internet . if you travel to that place with out the tour guide , that trip thats not at all going to be fun why because travel guide knows the history of each and every place we are going to visit . he will explain in you detail . if any thing happens to you like if you will be sick suddenly what will happen you just imagine this kind of situation . second is travel in a group that will be led by tour guide . there are many advantages . fisrt thing is in a group means you surely will have lot of fun . travel guide takes to different places , he will explain the history of those visiting places . one more thing he will fix the timings like at what time you have to get up ? , at what time you have to leave one place and go to another place . so you wont have much tension about this planning . travel guide will take care of all these . one more thing is we will get lot of concessions in lodging because as we are going by a group and travel guide might be knowing some familiar hotels , where he will get some concessions obviously amount of money we need to pay will be less . one important thing if suddenly we will be sick he will arrange us to go to the hospital as we are new to that place being a travel guide he might have known all the places and facilities what we will get . As there is a saying in english '' EVERY COIN HAS TWO SIDES '' . there are advantages and disadvantages but my advantages out weigh the disadvantages . Over all conclusion is every person once in their life time will travel to different places . if you travel in a group that led by tour guide you surely will enjoy the trip , you are going to have lot of fun . you are going to meet lot of different people , you can exchange their views , you can know about different cultures provided all this can be done , if we are guided by a travel guide . travel guide takes care of every thing . he will take our tensions by making us happy and he will see that we enjoy the trip .
(JPN,medium) I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Many products have advertisements their paccage or poster in the street or shop . I have not see same thing about products and advertisements . First of all , we often see advertisements of new products at street or shop . The advertisements make us want to buy . I have a experience . This is abut shampoo . A certain country broadcasted CM about the new procucts of shampoo . This made me wanted to buy , because the woman 's hair after used the shampoo is different it before used . Actually , I used that , but my hair did n't change . Also , we can say about foods . Foods paccage looks delicious , so we want to buy it . However , we have situation that actually it is not delicious . The campanies that want to sell more products try to use good pictures and phrases . In couclusion , we have a right that can choose food or something to use . We should not credit the advertisements easily . Sometimes we need to think more seriously about advertisements . In addition , we do n't have to forget that the advertisements is trap made by company to increase customers who buy the products . It is dangerous us to buy without thinking deeply about truth of foods . We should decide to buy more seriously .
(KOR,high) Either from news articles of a magazine or stories told by close friends and relatives , you 'll get many chances to hear about travels . In fact , travel is a common topic in conversation and an important part of our experiences . But , if you actually think about persuing a trip to a place you 've never been before , you 'll have to make a crucial decision on the method of traveling : travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a tour guide . But , considering the many pleasures you 'll miss by choosing a travel led by a tour guide , the former method cannot be the best way of travel . People , who support the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide , maintains that this method can reduce mistakes and accidents involved in confronting a new culture and place . For example , if you travel to Thailand and touch a person in the head by your left hand , you 'll find a irate person without really knowing the reason . Of course , travel with a tour guide will prevent these mistakes . But , as mistakes lead to better understanding of a different culture and make the travel itself more memorable , mistakes itself constitute a valuable part of your travel . People supporting travel with a tour guide is overlooking this essential part of travel . There are also disadvantages involved in travel in a group led by a tour guide itself . First , this kind of traveling leaves you with no opportunities to meet local people . As a great traveler and novelist in Korea once pointed out , three essential elements of travel are nature , food , and people . By traveling with a tour guide , you have to follow the rules in the group and are always busy following the group 's schedules . This leaves you no time to have a nice conversation with the local people and no chance to make a friend . This shows that travel with a tour guide is lacking one the essential elements of traveling . Second , travel led by a tour guide leaves no room for you to obtain a better understanding of the region . Of course , traveling in a group led by a tour guide will lead you to see the monuments that represent that region in a more efficient way . If you travel Rome , the capital of Italy , in this way , you will be very impressed with the old monuments such as the Colosseum and will want to visit again . But , you will miss the golden opportunity to see the various streets of Rome and better understand the current situation of Italy , which would 've led to a better understanding of the culture of Italy . In conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide prevents you from meeting the people of the local region and gaining a better understanding of the local culture . Even mistakes made by travelling without a guide will enrich your travelling experience and make it more memorable . Hence , the argument that the best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guide cannot be justified .
(KOR,medium) Nowadays , young people are the busiest people among their communities . They are called as people who are promising and hopeful in the future . They are the one who can bring nnovations and have the ability to change the world more favorably . Hence , we can not blame those young people being busy to work harder to keep up the steam . They do n't even have much time to helping their communities . For those young people , 24hours a day might be even a little short . Is it really ruthless to not give enough time to helping their communities ? Working harder and making effort continuously might be more beneficial later . They might bring a better world to live such as more comfortably and more favorably . This will cause the effect of happiness among many people . For instance , the world might turn into a very peaceful world with no wars nor struggles anymore so that there would be no more tragedy of separating families . Nevertheless , on the one hand , young people should give enough time to helping thier communities first . Every single work has to be done step by step . It would probably be better to start helping the communities rather than just concentrating on the future . If the communities do n't exist , there will be no more social lives in the world . The statement is quite true . In the 21st country , many people are very busy doing their own works or jobs . They hardly have time to helping out their communities . Their role is not only helping their communities but also making a hopeful world . They have got lots of things to do and accomplish . However , they have to bear in mind that working for communities are not the thing of wasting time , it is worth it .
(TEL,medium) In general , it is better to have both the tasks i.e. , Broad knowledge of many academic subjects and also specialization in particular subjects . Depending on the present concern , i prefer specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Having specialization in one specific subject shows ones own interest in picking particular subject of greater importance in the present trend of education . I prefer this because having broad knowledge on many academic subjects is of no use as all the academic subjects may not carry equal importance . Additionally , specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that we cannot have the ability to analyze the problems in all the subjects efficiently . This will make me more strong to have good command on one particular subject than having a broad knowledge of various academic subjects . Finally , i choose specialization in one specific subject superior to broad knowledge of various academic subjects is that we will be able to take up any challenge or if any problem in that particular subject can be efficiently sorted out with the command or the specialization on a particular subject . This efficiency cannot be achieved by having a broad knowledge over a subject . Ultimately , i believe that the specialization in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of academic subjects because we will be able to master that particular subject and also we can select the subject depending on the person 's interest and also the present boom for that particular subject . This is because , all the academic subjects may not be so important to learn so deeper . This makes me very strong to prefer specialization in one specific subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
(TUR,medium) The humankind always need to take risks to reach good life standards therefore taking risk is a very important aspects of humanslife . Some thinks that doing what they already know how to do well is better in contrary to those think that trying new things and takeing risks is more important to be successful . In my point of view , I personally agree the second idea . These are my following reeasons . First of all , taking risks is important to struggle with the difficult life conditions . For example , some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging , cycling . Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them ; however , if people want to enjoy the life more and be more healtier , they should try new and risky sports . It should n't be afraid of them to do risky sports . In addition to this , taking risks is a fundemental issue because of the experience the life more deeply . For instance , i always do the most difficult tests first at school . Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it . Although it means taking risks , i prefer to do it and anytime i did n't face with a bad situation . Therefore , it is really beneficial . The last but not least , taking risks is also important to see which can we do the best . For example , a footballer prefer to run not to long in the exercises . While he is doing that he does n't know if he run very long distances , after that he can be better in his job . Thats why it is important . All in all , as I said before to try new things and take risks is better that doing what they already know how to do well . In this content , to struggle with the difficult life conditions , to experience and to see which can we do the best are my reasons . Not only for successful people but also all of them , risk must be a part of our life in order to win the life exam whether we accept or not !!!
(CHI,medium) in my opinion , to agree or disgreewith it is a matter of balancing the pros and cons . because every thing or doing any thing has its advantages and disadvantages . just like a coin has two coins . for this title statement , many people think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do it while other do not agree . For my personal perpective , i agree with this statement . from countless factors with influence my choice , there are three conspicuous reasons listed following . the most important benefit is that the person can gain experience which other people can not when one trys new things and thake risks . both common sense and our experience have informed us that when can combine our knowlege with practice , and also make us know more about the things or risks . then we can do better next time . For example , my father is a succeful businessman . he always tries new things . about 10 years age , he tries to do something about sewege project . he had no experience at that time . but he said this preject would be developed in the future . so he worked hard on it alone . after 3 three years , he combine his knowlege with his working and got lots of experience . now he had a big factories and the bussiness is pretty good . he often tells me that if you want to be successful , you must have the courage to try new things and face challenges . in addition , another reason can be presented to develop my idea is that it can boarden your view , make you health strong and you will get confidence when you comeover the risks . it is obvious that it is good for a person to grow up . for example , when i was child , i was weak . and i tried to practise boxing . although i had never tried before , after i tried and kept , i am stong now . what 's more , trying things and taking risks can make you realise and know more about the society . it is particularly beneficial that you will know more about the life and society . you will know life is different and you will work hard in you life which is necessary for a successful people there are still many other reasonsthat can account for my agreeing this statement , but the obvious ones have been presented as above . once again , i would like to stater my opinion to this issue that i agree with this statement .
(ARA,low) yes i think it is much more important and easier for students to understand the ideas than learning them because if you try to understand something it would stay in your mind but if you tried to learn it , it would take so much more time , so i think for students its much easier to understand than to learn . for example : i tried my best to study things and learn them and i tried to understand , but you feel it inside you when you understand it you can keep it in your mind you know it by heart but when uyou learn you read it once and twice and three times but it would still be so much hard than understanding it . so i sudjest that you first should understand if not try to learn it and memorize it by heart .
(KOR,medium) I agree with the idea thinking the cars will be replaced with the better tools for transportation and more friendly to environment in the near future . Cars are the most common transporation tool for the present years . They are slower then flight but cheaper in cost , cheaper in cost then bicycles or whatever the vehicles manual forces should be put to operate but a lot faster and the cost is endurable for the common people comparing to flight fare . However they have been issued with envormental concerns that the cars produce harmful substances to the nature such as air etc . Of course in twenty years coming , people will try to invent the non harmful fuel to feed the cars for operation however I strongly believe the smart human beings , considered to be ` magic hands ' to invent whatever they need , olny the matter is the time , will get another brilient creation to satisfy the speed as plans , cost effective and also needs to be friendly to enviroment . It may have a form of car-like appearance , however if you meant the cars with speed like today and causing concerns like they do today , I may expect the new creation or invention ( will be named differently with CARS ) to replace the cars today . Let 's try to picture the things that have same look as cars nowadays but no wheels are flying here and there for common people 's daily transportation . There will be no much heavy traffic in the road as there is now . They are faster as planes and the fare is also endurable as I expect in the future , then not many people will be late for the jobs or classess being stuck in the traffic . Also the concerns about pollution by cars will be relieved . Some people might say twenty years are regarded to be too short for another stage of transportation system however , I reflected my little hope to have this ` mighty tool ' for my daily commuting to work in the near future in this writing .
(FRE,high) When you think about the advantages or disavantages of being young compare to be older , you can look around you and observe how many peoples try to stay young and in good health . Indeed , so many peoples take care of their body in order to stay young that they must be sad because they are becoming older . In this paper , we will present all the problems you avoid when you are young before listing some reasons why young people enjoy life more . First of all , a lot of mature adult stop enjoying their life because they are always thinking that it was better when they were young because they had less problems , they think that they were more beautiful and day after day the situation worsens . This kind of people waste a part of their life just because they are complaining about a time that they will never know again . Indeed , now they have more responsabilities , more pression because of their job and most ot them have a family which is a big responsability . All those reasons make them nostalgic about their former life when everything was so easy since they had just to think about themselves . The previous argument is true , young people can enjoy more their life because they have the freedom to do nearly everything , to take their own decision without involving the agreement of someone else . If you decide to leave in an other in one month , it will be so easier to do for a single or a couple compare to a family with three children . Moreover , i believe that young people are generally happier because they can still dream about a lot of thing , they can dream about a great family , a great house , a great job ... whereas mature adult have the experience and they have already noticed that sometimes , everything is not going according to plan . Finally , young people have a lot of spare time , they can do everything when they are still at university : sport , arts , shows , parties ... A lot of stuffs that people who have already a job can not carry on doing . To conclude , the main reason why young people enjoys their life more than older people is due to their personal situation . Indeed , an older people has a job , a family , less spare time ... even if you can have a lot of fun in your job and with your family , in my opinion , nothing can be as nice as the freedom you have when you are young and all the opportunities you still have to manage your life on the way you have decided .
(TEL,high) According to the question `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' I agree to the fact in the question . I feel that this issue is not in a specific country or community but its almost in the entire world of humans . Life compared to the past has changed a lot today . The generations today have a busy life of their own and may have forgotten their responsibilities of giving a helping hand to their community . In todays life the young people are busy with their jobs , own family , kids and are trying to give better comforts , good education and a luxirous living to their children . Talking about jobs or a busy profession there is so much competition among the co-workers to update themselves and go to better positions through promotions . In certain situations the young people forget the sacrifices their parents did for them , in bringing them up to a good position by giving them good education and providing all the nessicities they required in their childhood . There are a lot of old age homes comming up every where all over the world for the older community . The strong reason behind this is the older community is being neglected by the young ones . There are other reasons too in a developing country like India where the population is very high and there is a lot of unemployment , in such situations the youngsters have nothing to do for themselves and are helpless in their own situation and cannot do anything for their own community or older community . Financial burden is one factor that everyone faces today and the greed for a better position and a greed for more money make the younger generation selfish at times . So according to me the younger generation do not concentrate in helping their communities either the older or younger communities .
(SPA,high) People can learn through different methods . Some have an easiness for remembering charts , pictures or other graphics while others learn faster by literal means . The quality of the retention of those facts varies according to the way they retain them . When a student understands the idea of what he is doing , he can implement observations of his own . When one understands something , it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the details . He may even add new ideas . Once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyze it , judge it and compare it to former experiences . Understanding a concept makes it last much longer in the memory . We have a limited memorization time and space . For example , if you memorize your credit card number , you will remember it for a period of time . Once you stop using that number , the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few months . Our memory works best when we put to practice concepts and understand their functions and structures . On the other hand , simply learning facts leads to being able to hold back more details . You may know everything there is to know about a certain theme , but if you cannot understand it , you cannot change it or handle it . Think of it this way . Pretend you make a new friend . You may have read about this person before . You may know everything about him , from his blood type , to his hobbies , to his tastes , even his habits . If you do not understand the person , you cannot deal with him , or even maintain a lasting friendship . To truly know that person you must not only know about him , but also know him . To conclude , my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain facts . When you understand , you have the ability to change it , experiment it and even handle it . If the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime , the best way of remembering facts is to understand them .
(TUR,medium) I think I am a kind of person who likes doing what I already know how to do well and I think I am a successfull person . But I well know some of my friends who become so successful by trying new things . But I think these people are not too much . There are good reasons to try new things and it must be excited to take risk in some situations . But I think people should concantrate in just one aspect and should do just one work in a best way . People can be successful only doing the work that already know how to do well . Because you must spend some time and effort to learn new things . For instance I decided to learn playing viola at the beganing of the university instead of playing piano . I used to play piano when I was in primary school . I have never played viola before . Therefore I was unsuccessful . If I had chosen to improve my ability in piano I am sure I would become more successful . I think this statement is more about the trade . Because my father have a company and he prefer to do diffrent works regarding his own work . He always chooses to take risk . But sometimes he becomes successful and sometimes he does n't . I want him to go on doing he already do . Because he is well aware of this work and also he has good experiences in this work . But there is no insurance in the new work . He does n't well know whether he will be successful . Because of the reasons that I stated above , I do n't agree with this statement . According to my experiences I can say that , only the people who try to do things that they well know are successful people .
(GER,high) I disagree with the statement , that young people do n't help their communities enough nowadays , although it is a difficult topic to decide on . I understand how someone would come to making such a statement , seeing young people rather spending time hanging around at bus stops or the like , or not offering their seat to elderly people in the bus , or listening to them talk about how they do n't care about anything but themselves and their fun , or see them littering in parks or on the streets . However , I know a lot of people who are very devoted to helping others , to making the environment more comfortable for everyone to live in , or who are very considerate concerning their neighbours and other people . For example , the number of young people who decide to do a voluntary social service , helping and taking care of mentally and physically challenged people , or do an ecological service by fighting polution by putting information out or cleaning up the countryside , restoring national parks . Also , a lot of young people help out with communal events like elections , fairs . Sometimes they initiate such an event , or they simply help by counting votes , for example . And I 've seen young people sit in the public library and read to children every week , thereby making the happy and maybe help out the parents by taking over , at least for a little while . Another aspect that I feel should be taken into consideration is the following : Talking about how people nowadays do n't help their communities enough implies two things : firstly , that there was a time when young people were more devoted to their communities , and secondly , that there is a valid measure determining how much help , or how much time spent helping can be considered `` enough '' . I do n't think that young people of the previous generation devoted more time to their community , exept maybe for the fact that they spent a lot more time their , since they were n't as flexible travelling or choosing the location where to live as young people are today . Young people , especially when they are still preparing for later employment , often change location , when they start college or university , for example . And if one only spends a limited time in a community , there might not be enough time or opportunity to get properly envolved . As for the question how much involvement would be considered enough , I think that this is not a question with an absolute answer . Some people may think that helping out in a nursing home once a week for one or two hours would be enough , others would not even consider this amount of involvement worth mentioning . This last aspect alone , which boils down to a question of perspective , is why I cannot agree with the statement that young people do n't spend enough time helping their communities - this and my own experiences with numerous individuals , some of which I have mentioned above , which prove the contrary .
(TUR,medium) Enjoying life is not always directly related with the ages . Its actually requires both skills to be more dynamic as most of the young people do and to have more encourage as the older people have by their life experience . Maybe the word of dynamizm may not be enough to explain how is important to have a certain attitute to enjoying life . The one first must be peacefull with own and with surrounding . Then self-confidence becames and it makes the people more relax . Since most of the young people has much less concern to worry about than I agree the young people has more potential to enjoy life . Also the chemically wise that for sure there is much more activity in the body of young people . It might help to be more healty and dynamic and makes easy to live . Even emotionally , it is correct that the younger people are more active than the older ones . Do you think , all these fact says us that the younger people can enjoy life more than older ones ? Mostly but not entirely . There might be still something missing I guess . Young people are more suitable to get dissapointed by intersections between their great expectation due to huge imaginations and the concrete tough rules of the reality of life . They are also more attent to take weong decitions due to their blowing blood and rush of everythin . How the people can be happy with this dilemma ? Here the life experience comes as a solution . While the one gets more and more experience form the life - mostly the bad ones - then gain more abilit to evaluate better the conditions and to take better decisions , So finally it would be better to be a older who have younger blood .
(KOR,medium) People can choose between traveling with a group of people and alone . Some people prefor trip alone because they are able to enjoy travel without other 's interruption . However , I am in favor of traveling with a group escorted buy a tour guide . This is mainly because people are able to deal with a unexpected accidetns and it is easy way to get useful traveling information . First of all , people are able to ask help when they face the accident . As one might expect , one would be likely to meet the emergency while traveling . According , even though they fall in trouble , they are able to ask help to other members of group . To illustrate , according to the research by the Dong-A travel , one of the most renowned travel megazine in Korea , 71 % of people who travel alone experienced trouble . On the other hand , only 23 % of ones who travel with group of people falled in the dangerous situation . If they had traveled with their friends , they would have avoided the emergency . Furthermore , traveling with a group and tour goide is easy way to get informatin . It is obvious that travel guide have large amount of information about the new location . Consequently , by traveling with guide , people are able to get useful information about the new place and exchange with group members . For instance , when I was freshman , i traveld to the Europe with my friend . I did not have any knowledge about the Europe . However , one of my friend , whose major is european history , give us large amount of knowledge related to the Europe . If i had traveld alone , i would not got the useful information . In brief , I stongly agree with the idea that travel with a group led buy a tour guide is best way to enjoy travel . This is laregely because , individuals are able to avoid the emergency and are able to get useful information easily . All in all there is a saying , `` The more , the merrier . ''
(HIN,medium) The importance of the facts is greater over the ideas and concepts or vice versa . This the qustion every student must have asked in his carrier . The effectivness of the fact cant be questioned but the theories and the concepts gave us most of the investion , they have given the logical eplanation to the many things , its only because of the ideas and concepts , it has also solved many problems that cant be done only with the facts . Firstly , ideas and cocepts have give birth to many of the investion which according to the fact are not possible , for example if , the wright brothers wolud might have stayed to the fact that its almost imposible for the man to fly , but they had an idea a concept which tuned that thing in to fact of today . Secondly , facts do provide better explanation but they cant reason the phenomen or the act they might have occured . The ideas and concept provide a logical explation they have given many managemant theories which have lead to the drastic changes and many helpful jobs . The strengths of the ideas and fact cannot be neglected but the facts do play a important role its the facts which enables those theories to go forward and to be more effective . Lastly the ideas and concept has to given stree than facts to the students .
(SPA,medium) If we are taking about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least as many cars as today . It is a possibility that in modern countries , we will use the car less and less with the pass of the years . We live in growing cities , every day a higher pertentage of the population lives in cities . And every one that live in a big city can tell you the unusefull and expensive bussines is to have a car . Is much more eficent to take the public transportation system or even a motorbike , or even a bike . Any of this solutions is cheaper and faster than moving thoughout the city by car . In addition we have the problem of the petroleum . We are aproaching to the famous peak oil . Some day in the close future we could not attend all the energetic demand of the world just with oil . So oil and fuel will enhance his prizes , and having a car will be more and more expensive every day . So not every one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it as today . But in the other hand there are a lot of high populated contries , developing countries . Is reasonable to suppose that many people of these contries will be rich enough to pay for a car and its manteinance . Also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbols of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary . So although in Europe and the USA , we will probably have less cars , in China , India or Brasil the number or cars will certently increase a lot in the next few decades . So this is the reason I do not agree the statement above .
(HIN,high) I agree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and support the following belief of mine with the following views . Firstly , being young means full of energy and the biggest advantage is physiological . A young person is fit and healthy both . This makes him to be open to new things , he experiments , innovates and takes risks which brings achievement and sense of accomplishment . The high amount of adreanaline helps him to work hard and enjoy harder . Secondly , at younger age you have less resposibilities . You dont have children to bother about , you need not to worry about your pensions , provident funds and all that , all you bothered about is the present . You have a long way to go and suspense about the future keeps you on front foot . Thirdly , at younger age you are on the verge to build new relations , you love rain , you love dancing in it , you experince the first touch and get to introduce yourself to a new sensation called love , it makes your world colourful , you wait for night to pass on and wait for dusk to get a gilmpse of someone you love . You marry and enjoy the life with your partner , you became social , you became caring and bothered about another person . All this makes life more colourful . And when time passes by and you notice physiological changes within making you weak , you start worrying about a lot of thing to do before you say goodbye . You fear the ultimate truth ie death approachinhg towards you with a lot of thing which are still pending . You feel either you are running out of time or you have nothing to do and just wait for the judgement day . You are worried about your children and their future . Thus , at some time at the later stage you feel that life was very joyful when you were young therefore i think that young people enjoy life more that old people do .
(TEL,medium) I agree to the statement that In twenty years tere will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I can support my statement with few explainations or reasons and examples . I strongly believe that people use cars as their means of journey instead of taains and buses . I believe that people would prefer for personal , sophisticated and joyful journey . All this is possible only by having personal cars . Let me explain with a reasonable reason . People work through out the day . During weekends they feel to have ecstacy or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin jobs donre by them trough out the week . So they may spend their leisure time with their parents or friends . When it comes to spend time with friends or siblings than they surely prefer to hav long rides or long journeys . So the best way is to have a personal car . Because if an individual go for tain or bus as hios means of travelling than he or she has to wait for the train or bus until it comes and he or she can visit only those places where the bus or train can go . He or she cannot enjoy the pleasure that the nature gives . But when an individual has got a personal car than he or she can go to any beautiful corners of the nature . There is one more advantage . Whenever an individual gets exhausted through his journey than he can stop somewhere and relax for a while and can visit any mani restaurents nearby to have some stuff . Is int advantageous ? Ofcourse it is . We can have lot of privacy in our own personal cars . Finally one damn advantage by having a personal car is we can reach our destiny in time instead of wasting time in wating . The destiny may be anything like office or a party etc . So if we are a bit cautious in driving than personal cars are more advantageous and I conclude that in the coming years everybody prefer cars .
(HIN,medium) Young people enjoy life more than older people . There are two aspects of this statement . Time does not stop for anyone . Every person faces the every age group of a man 's life . When a person takes birth it is in his infant stage . Later he grows and passing through aldolence , young , middle age groups and reached the last age group that is old age group . So all age groups are indespensible part of man 's life . One aspect of the statement is that young age is the time when a person gets full freedom in his or her life . Usually in this age a person leaves away from the home . So he or she is away from any family tension , restriction etc . Definately this is the time when a person can enjoy the life maximum . To enjoy the life young people go to parties and disco every other day . Young peolple go to different trips for enjoyment . This is the age where there is no reason for parties . Reason is just one that is enjoyment . But I would like to add one thing more that this is the age when a person can learn maximum from his or her life . Person of young age learn to manage while living in a room with other room mate during college studies . This is time when a person is also more concern about carrier . He or she having a lot tension for carrier . Another aspect of this satemant is that to enjoy the life , depends upon a individaul 's views , way of thinking , attitude towards life . A person having positive attitude can live happy in any age group . Old people do have a lot of exprience of life . They have already seen many ups and downs of the life . So in this age they like to spend time peacefully . At this age this a sought enjoyment for them . So they also feel happy in playing with their grandson and granddaughter in garden , going church , read bible , travelling different hill stations , get togther of old friends , going to club etc . Another thing is that a young with negative attitude even can not live happy in the age of most enjoyment . Although young people enjoy life more than older people but it also depends on a individaul 's attitude towards life .
(TUR,high) I agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it . In order to make them reachable , ideas and concepts should be followed by real facts taken from everyday 's life experiences . To illustrate with an example , a concept such as ` freedom ' has a very broad meaning and therefore it may be difficult to categorize and confine it with a few sentences . It should be presented with examples from different places around the world , related to people with completely different cultural backgrounds . Important facts that changed the course of the history should be given . The first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the French Revolution . It changed the face of the world in a very positive way . This would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who wants to live his/her life proudly and respectfully . Everyone has a right to make his/her own decision and respect other people 's decisions . Also , one should have the freedom to express him/herself . There should be a tolerance and respect toward different opinions . Scientists , writers who are killed violently because of their opinion should be given as examples to illustrate the danger when one overtakes another 's freedom of expression . With freedom comes another concept which is ` equality ' . This idea can also be supported by many historical events that took place and still take place . People with different races , religion and culture should be treated equally . There should be no judgements on peoples ' opinions based purely on which religion or culture they belong to . Unfortunately , even today , we see many examples of inequality . Every day newspapers are full of them , and I think a professor will have no difficulty to show students a few facts illustrating the examples of inequality .
(TEL,medium) Education is a perfect amalgation of understanding of learned facts and their application . This is the essence of education . No theory states education is learning facts blindly . If learning facts matter a parrot can speak learnt rubbish. a lot better than a man can . It is understanding of the ideas and their application which make a good student and distinguish him from an ordinary graduate . Education does not mean learning facts by heart or reading lit of text books . I was taken by surprise when I accidentally noticed paintings by small kids . One of them was named ` Flowers ' and the child drew blue colour for rose and black colour for sunflower . Later when I was going to my house I noticed a streeboy smaller than that age drawing flowers in the ground using chalk pieces and colouring them perfectly . Not all things are taght in the book , some are taught by life . Personal experiences value more than reading ` rose is red ' . If Sir Issac Newton have had learnt the facts there would be no ` Theory of gravity ' . Innovative thinking adds a lot to the vision of understanding facts . Learn trade rather than remember what is trade . If Albert Instein would have learnt the fact that atom has electrons , the fact goes to the next generation as atom has electrons ; but because he understood what is atom we today enjoy atomic energy through Theory of Relativity . If mere learning of facts is education , then that education fetches nothing but only useless graduation degrees to our back . If we understand facts then we know how to manipulate the lnowledge we know for a better work . With the modern busy life many dont have time to understannd ideas . What all they have is time to learn facts . If learning facts blindly is education then that education is useless . If a student learns what a machine is and has never seen a machine or never seen a machine at work , he only remembers the formulae of working of the machine and nothing else . In practical life he is not more than a fool or a numbskull .
(ARA,medium) In my opinion having more broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is much better and comfortable . Having more knowledge subjects can make people more intrested to talk about differnt subjects in his life . A peson who is specialized in one specific subject is stuck in many things in his life . While the person with many knowledged acadmic subjects xan access many different jobs and aplication and will have experience than than the person with one specfice subject . Having more broad knowledged academic subjects makes apersons life much easier . In my opnion I agree that having many knowledged academic subject is more better than having one specific subject . A person with a little specified subject will find it very hard to find jobs and it will be very hard for him to mange his life and to do many things in his life . But having more than one spefied academic subject makes your life much easier and it makes you experince your life better and also he can find more than job and application to work in not only that but large companies are going to send him an invitation to in the company itself . And one of the achivment a prson with abroadr knwoledge academic subects can achive is being experienced in many things . So for people who has alittle amount of specifed subjects I advice them to take more academic subject than the subjects he has . He will be able to help people in many things and he can do many goood things .
(HIN,high) A man goes for an interview thinking he is right for the job . He does not know that only bookish knowledge in his related subject will not help in getting that job . Neways , he goes to the interview and he is questioned about many other topics in addition to his related field and obviously due to his lack of knowlegde he is unable to give the satisfactory answers to the questions . This situation would not have arised had he been an expert in other subjects as well . Hence i am for the topic that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject . Nobody can be perfect . Learning is a process we have to undergo throughout our lives . Nobody can succeed if he knows only a restricted source of information . A person should hence plan what he is goin to learn during his core education years which begin for most people at highschool and continue throughout college . Specialization is not a bad activity but it is not a smart decision to specialize in one subject at the cost of the others . When speaking in public or even when talkin amongst friends for that matter woud n't it be great if one was filled with academic knowledge and intellectual odassity ? Nowadays people are specializing in more than one subject . Has anyone ever wondered why ? All this is being done due to a change in thinking and a new approach of wider horizons and not a mental block that one should be efficient only in his or her related field of work . A person can grow his worth by havin broader knowledge of various academic subjects as he will be able to tackle practical problems faced in life better his vast source of information and the large bank of knowledge he accumulated in his learning years . The world is changing , the challenges are becoming greater , cut-throat competition is taking place nowadays and thus only the best of the best can survive in todays world where people are continously striving to reach higher in life . All this can be made a lot easier if a person has a varied source of knowledge to bank upon and thus people should have a broad knowledge ofn academic subjects than to specialize in one specefic subject .
(KOR,medium) In the long run , Understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts becasue understanding main concept let students to adapt constant understanding about new facts in the long period time , and because students can approach to the factors more intuitively and effectively . Fisrt , understanding concept will help the student adapt the new factors in the long run . For example , major business principles learnd in school and informations from pop-bussiness books has different values . The principles may not be easy to use in the real word , but they are proven to be valuable in the long preriod while pop-business books usualy hits in very shor time period . One of the papular movement called ` Six sigma ' was thought to be a perfact solution of the future market , but it became a cause of less inovation of company because it based on a particular fact in the short time period and ignored lots of key concepts in business principles . Second , understanding concepts first will be more effective to understand facts . If a group of business students are given lots of raw datas such as new papers and statistics without learning basic concepts , then they will not be able to understand what the data actually means and their misunderstanding can be greater . This type of learning will be a lot slower than understanding main concepts first . In conclution , I believe that understanding concepts first is better in the long run , because it will let students adapt to various problems , and the students will be able to learn more effectively in the limited time .
(JPN,high) I disagree with the statement , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . The first reason why I disagree with the statement is that I know young people who spend time in helping their communities . In my university , there are activities that involve helping the community . For example , there is a marathon coming up this month , and some of my classmates will help organize this event . It involves interacting with the community , and it should be a great help for the community . The second reason why I disagree with the statment is that young people do not have enough time to spend on their communities . If they go to school or college , they have to spend time on their study , so even if they have the will to spend time helping their communities , they cannot do so because they just do not have the time . I think that it is enough for young people to help when they can , and that it should not be something that they are forced to do . I am busy most of the time studying , and it is hard for me to participate in events just because I do not have enough time . A third reason why I disagree with this statement is because I do n't think there is enough information sent to young people about events that are happenening in their community . If they do not have the information , they cannot help , even if they have the will to do so . I know that if I look hard for information , I should be able to find ways in helping my community , but it is not easy to find this kind of information . In conclusion , I think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities . There are people who are actively involved in activities in their communities , and if they have the time and information , I think many people will be willing to help . I think the most important thing to do is to inform young people about events happening in their communities . I think that accusing young people for not helping is wrong , and that there is a need for an environment that makes young people want to participate in helping their communities .
(HIN,low) AGREE The traveling with a group is good tour guide because whenever you go some where with the group so this is a good chance to know much more about the new places and this could be better amusement for you . This is also the fact that you do n't need to travel in a group because somewhere you feel like to go alone and most of the peoples do n't want the company of others this is why this thought can not be applyed to every one . Most of the peoples really want a company of some people because they do n't want to travel in group . According to the tour guide it may be the best way because in your group most of the peoples know and they can give you the better idea that where you have to go and wher you can get a lot of fun and they can tell you where you are going wrong . As a matter of fact it might be a good tour gide . Traveling is very importen to the peoples to know about world and in group ti could be might as well .
(CHI,high) I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . As we all know , technology and science is developing quickly nowadays . So there is a big market on producting and consuming on cars . How could human beings can drop this golden opportunity to make money ? Fisrt , if you live in a big city with a car available , you can easily get to the destination where you want to be . You do n't need to get on crowded buses and waste a long time just for waiting buses ' coming . For examples , in the late evening if you have something urgent and also we know that it is really hard to get a taxi or bus , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solved . Second , now cars are invented in different styles and even you can choose what contents in it . So they are access to your needs such as high-quality stero inside the car . Then you can enjoy the music during your driving . And more and more cars will be produced by car factories . The price of cars must be dropped to the level that ordinary people can afford it . Finally , new energies are being invented by scientists . They will soon be used instead of petrol and gasoline . That is to say that cars will scarcely pollute our environment . So we do n't need to worry about those gases such as carbon dioxides and acid rain which destroy atmosphere and constructures of our city . All in all , we can clearly see that how a car is convenient to our life . My friends always proud of that their can drive a car and they are very addicted to the enjoyment of process in driving . So we can infer that there will be more and more people who are willing to buy their own cars and that will promote our country 's develpment .
(FRE,high) As far as i am concerned , I think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities . Maybe my answer seem to appear like selfish even if it is not my aim . At first sight , i think that nowadays young people has got a great deal of work to do and therefore less freetime . For instance , young people must go to university to study but on top of that most of them are forced to work besides their study to earn some money in order to pay their school . As a result , it is hard for these young people to find the time to helping their communities . Actually when you finish your school at the end of the day you want to escape from reality and therefore relax and ease the tension of the day 's hard work . You do not want in your leisure time to go and help your communities . I am conviced that when you are young you have to take advantage of life . Consequently , you have to enjoy yourself and have fun because you know that one day when you will become a grown up you will have to support responsabillities and obligations in your town or city . Moreover , sometimes in certain situations young people wo n't have enough experience to deal with the problem whereas older person will make the right decision . Nevertheless , it is undoubtful that helping communities might be a rewarding experience for young people because they will improve their knowledge thanks to the older advices . In fact , it should be an opportunity for young people to evolve in a good way . Even if these young people think that helping their communities is a misfortune it can also appear as an asset because thay can learn a great deal of things that will help them in the future . But the main problem as always is time .
(KOR,medium) Today each person can have own car without many problems . Having car is becoming more easy in many sides . So increasing of cars can be considered like a obvious result of modern society . But if we think about the future furthemore there may be a completely another situation wating for us . There are some elements able to limit the car increasing in future . First of all , the development of telecommunication will defenitely decrease needs to move . All texts , datas , graphics or even sound elements can be transported by internet so we wo n't need to move out to get our office to work . Payment is also getting informatised because we are using credit cards and telebanking system . All the concepts of our life are getting non-materializing and they exist just in internet 's web . Decreasing of transports of materials will reduce the number of cars as a transport way . In these times there are n't many private airplanes but in future the airplanes or another system will replace cars . Technology is very fastly changing and progressing . Car will be one of material of last days we wo n't use anymore . Soon there will be a another system which can fill the lack that a car could n't acomplete or who can solve problems that a car was provoking like pollutions or accidents . The main reason that I suppose of car decrease is there are a lot of problem made by cars . Most of people died because of car accidets than illness . Certainly there will be a onother way of transportauin that humanbeing will find out . Nowadays cars are defenitely increasing all over the world . But i think this is a temporary phenomenon in our time . The decrease of cars may not occur in twenty years but we can expect that will obviously happen in days coming
(HIN,medium) Yes it is true that successful people bound themselves in such a way that they are always inclined t do new thing and do traditional things in innovative ways rather than adopting the same old methods . I had been working with a lawyer who is very ambitious and at such an age i.e. 60 yrs. he is so energetic and filled with ideas that rare can challenge . There had been various examples in Indian history where people employed new techniques and tok risk and succeeded . One of such example is Sunil Bharti Mittal ( AirTel ) in the initial days when he was struggling , an idea of key pad phone clicked him , at that time India was not used to Key Pad telephone instruments . There were boring round mechanical instruments with out any features except to connect people . Then there came the era of Key pad phones and it was a revolution for India , many faclities were provided in those instruments . Though it was a hit and trial effort but it worked and it was the risk that this person took and made life comfortable . Then the era of Mobile phones came and now lots of players have come into operations and competing with each other . There is another success story of Maruti Car . Initially in India , i.e. after independence the car available in India was Ambassador of Fiat no other car was available in India except for the imported ones and that can be afforded by people with big pockets only . This problem was solved by Mr. Sanjay Gandhi who is the key person fr entry of Japanese Cars into India . Maruti in collaboration wth suzuki was ntroduced in the year 1984 and people welcomed it with great respect . though it was a risk taken by that person , it worked and today it has superseded all other cars available in India . This is how success stories begin and continues . They say sucess is a journey and not a destination .
(ARA,medium) I dissagree with the statement that say `` it is more imprtant for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' becasue of many reasons . First of all , they will learn more about the facts becase it is real and they will believe it so it would help them more and more . In addittion the ideas will not help them becasue they can forget them quickly and it could be wrong . Second , it would help them it their lifes and give them more experinse and lesons . Such as if anyone of the students had strange question maybe he had learn from that facts alot of information that would help him to solvie it . Third , they will learn about new things that they have not know about it . Moreover it would get to the other generation . So that facts would be inhertants for all genetation and all of them can get what they want to know about . Also that information that they get from the facts would make them more serious with this life . In addition it would make people who were sleep to wake up and go to worke because facts have many ture and strange information . In the end I see that the facts much better that the ideas because the ideas might be wrong and it will efect our society . So , learn facts is much betters becase all the people and sientise kwon about it .
(FRE,high) Academic education has always been a debated issue because it deals with lots of purposes . One main point that is being more and more discussed is if it is better to acquire knowledge in many academic subjects or to specialize in a specific subject . We will see that even if a specialized academic curriculum can be rewarded , having knowledge of many subjects can help to be open-minded and can be useful in daily life and society . First , avoiding specialization at school or at university permits to develop curiosity and to have an opened mind . Indeed , could you imagine what would be the consequence of only teaching biology to a ten-year-old child ? He would only focuse all his life on that subject . I believe that is the same for academic subjects . We must learn a lot from others subjects that the one we are going to work on all life . Having classes of history or economics can help you to remain interested in different subjects . Moreover , the more the knowledge is diverse the more it is easy to face real situation . Only learning at university does not always help to know how to behave in specific situations . By attending to a diverse range of courses , this lead to a faster adaptation and understanding of the environment . For instance , a manager should have learnt different aspects of the economic business . If he only focuses on acconting , he will not be able to understand the Marketing team with which he will have to work . However , it is necessary at a time to be specialized in one subject . To take the example of a plummer , he needs to be sure of he is doing to to work . If we did n't have to specialized , everybody should know how to produce a pen or how to repair a car . Though I fully agree that sometimes it is relevant to specialize in a specific subject , I still believe that it is necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it permits to be curious and open-minded , to know how to behave in new environment and in daily life .
(TEL,medium) I agree the statement that , from the Past we come across the fact that younger people enjoy their life more compared to the older people . People enjoy their life alot when they are young . younger people has the stamina and consistency to do the their work which cannot possible for the older people . The are several reasons that old people cannot enjoy more than the young . Firstly , because their stamina is not consistent after becoming older . There are several facts , some og them are they cannot eat their own food , they cannot getup themselves unless a person can help them . secondly their maturity mind will not be same as when they are younger . For example , my grandmother who is 80 years old she cannot do her own work by herself desperatly she a need help either from my mom or dad . For instanace one day my grand mother sicked up and she cannot move a side from her bed then my mom helped her to take bathroom . these are the some of facts of peole whose age is arround 60's . we can know from the above statement that older people arround 60's cannot do their own work then how can they enjoy like younger childrens of 10 - 20 years children . Once , when i are palying cricket in groung near by side of my house , my grand father came and said he want to play the cricket . He played a single ball he suffered from severe chest pain . The older people has no consistant and stamina compared to the younger one . older people arround can enjoy their life in different fassion by leaving with their childerns and sparing alot of time with grand childrens . ofcousre what they will expect more than that . Their are both advantages and shortcomes for younger and older people enjoyment . younger people enjoy playing with others and palying jokes and roaming here and their in bikes . most of the times people enjoy while they are in schools . The older people enjoy in their fashion buying some toys and neccessity items for the grand childrens and made them happy ofcousre no one can expect much more than that . hence , I conclude that younger people enjoy their life in their own fassion and older people enjoy in differently from youngers which mentioned earlier in the passages . i prefer both palys an important role in their lifes .
(JPN,low) I believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to one specific subjects . The reason is , narrow knowledge is very unuseful . For example , when I am a student studying about only one academic subject , and if I must change the theme of study , I will in trouble and at a loss . Because in the situation , I must study other subjects from very basic parts . But if I have widespread knowledge about other subjects , I will change my theme easily . But studying broad subjects is giving up to gain profound knowledge in the same time . One subject taker can spend his time for the subject only , therefore it makes him a professional of the subject . On the other hand , many subject taker must spend his time for each subject . So , wide subject taker may have just sharrow knowledge about each subject . This is the wrong point of studying many subject . But , I think , there is no reasons to have profound knowledge . Because profound knowledge is useless in the social life . Example , while I am working , I use no deep academic knowledge . Deep academic knowledge makes no money .
(TEL,medium) I agree that young people now a days are not giving enough time to develop their communities . they are not having as much time to help their community because now a days the yong people are more intrested in enjoying their life by simply going to movies and just by roaming . moreover , every one is seeing their own life style not bothering about the society . which is very harmfull to the nation . And life had became more mechenical . no body is showing intrest to help their communities . while living in a same place avery body in that place must be communicate each other . only young people in that particular area have to move by their own to help the community which will show the right path to the next generation . We have give motivation to others for helping their communties for the better society . Just by spending 5 % of the day we can acheive a lot , moreover it gives self satisfaction of their own . From the age of schooling only parents must give right direction to their children to acheive the target . By this the spirit will also develop more in the children . The things that we can do in little time to help the community will show the long lasting name . which will give more spirit and encouragement to do more needfull things in future . So , the younger people are to be motivated in this way to help their communities just by spending little amont of time that has been wasted by roamin and chatting . If every body do the same we can acheive better society at a very short time Thus , the younger people must have to spare some time to halp the community which will be shown right path to the next generation ..
(HIN,high) Knowledge helps an inidvidual in making his career and helps him earning his livelihood . I believe that its better to specialize in specific subject because having broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes the person `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' . Even in today 's world where education holds lot of importance in both professional and personal lives knowledge in one specific field only proves helpful . Studying in one specific field helps an individual in acquiring maximum knowledge about that feild . with this person has to focus only on one subject this reduces his burden and he tries to excel in that feild . These days requirement is increasing more of specialised people . For example , demand for heart surgeons in hospitals is increasing day by day because of increasing heart problems . Patients also prefer going to those doctors who are specifically for those problems which they are suffering from rather than going to the general physician because they trust specialist doctors more . like for any eye problem they will go to eye specialist , Studying in one specific field helps at professional level also . Big companies are recruting only those individuals who specialise in one subject only . They donot higher those individuals who have bit of knowledge in all fields but rather they prefer hiring those people who have specialised knowledge of the feild in which the company deals because these inidividuals who are masters in one subject will help in company ' s growth and development . They willl bring recognition to the company . Students also prefer doing masters in one subject only because if they specialise in one subject this will bring for them more growth opportunities , more job opportunities and more recognition . As I have done my graduation in the field of interior designing but I am planning to do my mastersas commercial designer because today 's market is full with interior designers but people prefer going to the specialists of all the fiilds . Like for kitchen designing they prefer going to kitchen specialist , for landscape designing they would go to landscape specialist , for furniture designing they will hire furniture designer . Even client 's want masters for all the works they want to do . Even lot of renowned and reputed colleges give degree in one psrticular field . In the coming times there will be more need of specialised people . As scientists try to study and do reasearches in one field only because if they will try doing researches in all fields their work will be messed up and world wo n't get all advanced electronical gadgets or luxuries of life . So different scientists work in different fields and that too of their interest . So in the end I would like to conclude that its always better to sutdy and specialise in one subject only because with this person is able to focus in one direction only and doesn ; t get hampered by other things and this brings more recognition and growth opprtunities in his life and his life becomes more organised ,
(ITA,medium) The statement propose could be considerate correct in some cases but incorrect in others . The two possibilities rappresent two kind of ideas , and the use of the first one , in opposite of using of the second one is different case by case . I prefear to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject . The motivation of my personal choose is the strong possibilities rappresented by this opportunities . If you are the best in an argument you will be called everytime someone need help on it . An example is the use of computers in general . In my university group I am the best in using of computers and when some friends of mine have problem with computer , he ask me how he can to resolve his problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too . They call me because they know I am able in using computer and they call me only in this cases . I am able also to resolve maths problems , but my friends never call me to resolve this type of problem , because I have some friends of mine more able than me to resolve this kind of problem . I use this example to demonstrate that if a person want to decide of use the second sentence he must be shure of to be very strong in the argument he choose else is better choose the first sentence . The first sentence get opportunities for whom is able to organize himself . the knowledges of many academic subjects permit of use everykind of knowledge in all type of academic subjects . Is not easy do that and I think this kind of possibilities is for few persons . In the end I can say that I use specialize myself in one specific subject , but I am not agree with second sentence , but I think everyone have to choose the best opportunities for himself .
(TEL,medium) Today autombiles plays a mojor role in travellig near by places in which car 's play a major role . It is now becoming less expensive and people are interested in owning their own car 's . They had became a symbol of royality and very prestigious issue . Today with the advancement in technology lot of manufacturers came out with different models which are very attaractive , with improving mileage and with some additional features . Man is not satisfied with what he had and what he has acheived , so day by day he is introducing a lot of varieties into the markets . Today everybody is in a feeling that to enjoy the life with what he has . So man feels that if he had a car the society will show respect towards him and he himself fells very proud . There are not only local manufacturers but also has international market in producing different types of cars such as family car 's , sports car 's etc , . Newly invented cars are running with gas which causes less damage to the environment . This cars are less expensive and most people are now using these car 's . The development of any nation is mainly depend on its road ways so nowaydays roads are being extended or widened which decreased the occurance of accidents . In ancient days the people who has car is considerd to have a great social status but nowadays it became common source for every one . Buying cars now a days increased drastically so this will continue in future . Today there is no country in the world with out using the cars with man 's hectic and busy schedules
(TUR,high) Many different approaches are used in the education system of an educational community . Mainly ; two types of approaches emerges in a school curricula ; one is practical application of issues which profoundly depends on the understanding of the ideas and concepts ; the other one is undoubtedly the theoretical approach which focuses on the merely comprehending of the facts and details . As far as I am concerned and as being a student for a considerable amount of my life-time ; I am a proponent of the practical approach and think that schools must pay attention to teach ideas and concepts and should provide each student a broad vision to comprehend them throughly . There are a number of important reasons I can settle down about the beneficial points of the practical approach ; meaning ; procuring students with the ideas and concepts . The main advantage that may come along with such an attitude in an education system is the fact that students can learn how various people applied-otherwise saying practiced - the facts . They are not only feeded with raw material ; but ; also application of the facts ; their processed form is also given to them . During a school life ; a student may not value the importance of the facts learned . And ; this was what exactly happenned to me and my classmates in the philosophy class in the lycee . I have always considered that class as a base one to understand the very basics of science as it teaches to think in both quantitative manner and also abstract way . But ; I have graduated from lycee being devoid of having the abilities in pholosophic thinking . Because ; our teacher would talk about the facts all the time . For example ; when she talked about the evolution of the world and the facts related to it ; she never touched to the various ideas proposed by celebrated philosophers such as Sokrates and Platon . As a virtue of our teacher `` s educational approach ; we learned to memorize the facts ; furthermore denied acceptance on thinking on further ideas or concepts . To sum up and to cut the story short ; it is much more important and further beneficial to make students learn the ideas and concepts which are the application of various facts solely or in combination with other facts . It is true that we cannot deny the importance of facts as they highly depend on the facts . Evaluation and validation of an idea related to a fact may further make it possible for a student to develop his or her own ideas .
(KOR,medium) Modern society become complex more and more . A man ca n't do well on everything due to this complexity . I argue that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . There are two reasons in the below . Although people can have broad knowledge from many academic subjects , it is too nallow to use in real world . But by specializing in one specific subject one can get depth knowledges of one field . And he or she can make use of these knowleges for real world , specially job . In my expieriences I can make use of my knowlege from my major . And a famous survey done by an university states that 70 % of attendants think that their special knowledges is useful for their job . Futhermore one can become a specialist in a field . As I mentioned before modern society is too complex . So it is easy way to make a success that is to be a specialist in a field . Many experts recommend that if you are to make a success , first you become a specialist . According to a survey in korea 60 % is specialist out of 500 executives in major companys . In sum I think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . In korean old saying , `` dig just one well . '' Although one digs many places , water does n't
(SPA,low) Well , i think that the statement has 2 ponits of view , i i can assure you because of my personal life experience with my acttual own business . The First Point of view Like Donald Trumph there are many people that take new risk in business ( for instance ) and start campaings totally diferent that usuall . Donal is a Real State business man , a constructor developer , a golf court owner , and recently a TV host with the Apprentice ! So he try to do the best in many areas , obviuosly very well researched , because when you have success you leanr some rules that teach how to be on top allways no matter what , por example : a. Think possitive b. Fail is good , because you learn from it c. You allways have to be surrounded by people smatest than you , in order to make a team that helps you achieve your goals . d. You have to serve ALLWAYS , because you are a person who works for the people and that people is the one that give you the success . e. You have to be a visionare or a pioneer , and see what other ca n't see to help the society grew up . Well as you see my point of view is like the business side because i like it and i know a lot . The Second Point of view BUT in the other hand , my own experience teach me that if i get lazy and sleeps on my success i can not do new things because i allways be waiting the same success from the same source and keep all my risk down , because i `` think '' i 've got the FOREVER formula and try to stay in my status quo . In sumary , i think that the human been that is successful , have to probe him self that he CAN DO IT in other areas different in order to stay alert and grew up in knowledge , perfection and happiness . Thanks
(JPN,high) I agree with this statement , but students should also understand the facts . Students should undertstand the ideas and concepts of the subject what they learn becuase they will not be able to comprehend what the subject is explaining . However , the best way to learn is students should also learn the facts . They must learn the ideas , concepts , and the facts . First example is when students were reaserching for the famous black people from history , students must understand the ideas and concepts of their reaserch . Then , they would be willing to study about the people from black history . After they finished reaserching about black people , the teachers should give the comments about their projects . Then , students would understand what they missed from their the information about black people . Second example is when students need to solve the math word problem . Students who do not like the math will not concentrate during the math class . Therefore , the math teachers must explain the concepts of learning math . Then , the teachers should let the students to think about the math problem and find the answers first . It is important to let the students to think about the problem first and teach students the facts of the problems later . Third example is when students were trying to get the solution of the chemistry problem . The quick way to get the answer is just ask to the teachers , but that is a bad idea for students . Students must understand the idea of the chemistry and students will be able use this idea and figure the other problems . Then , students should check with their teacher what the students got from their understanding . As you read , these are the examples that students should underdtand the ideas , concepts , and facts . The important point of learning for students is to try to figure the problems themselves , but if they cannot get the solution , they need to understand the ideas and concepts . Then , stundents would eventually comprehend the facts .
(TEL,medium) According to me , Ideas and concepts form the base for successful understanding of a subject . Facts are also important for subjects like history or biology . But having knowledge only of facts , Student cannot fetch much . Facts can be developed if a student possess an understanding of ideas and facts . There are many daily life examples that would differentiate the importance between both . For example , let us consider a pocelin flower vase that is placed on a table at one corner of the house , a child may break it though hearing the fact that the porcelin would break . but , if a child has the idea regarding the product , if he has a knowledge about the charecteristics of porcelin then he would never break it . unless and until something happens accidentally . If students possess a background knowledge about a product or anything they would handle it with care . Having knowledge of Ideas and concepts would help students in their research work . With ideas and concepts they can enhance the existing theory and develop a new theory . facts are also important but possessing facts alone cant help students enhance an existing theory . Having knowlede of facts holds good for subjects like history and political sciences . these are the subjects where dates have to be remembered . when talking about other subjects like computer sciences , it is necessary that students possess idead and concepts about the subject . For example when a team is woking on a project ( each person allocated different job ) and suppose a person leaves suddenly then it becomes the responsibility of the rest of the team to complete the project . This can be done if the students possess ideas and concepts regarding that part of the project whick is left by a person . Hence the above reasons holds good in convaying that facts are important but ideas and concepts are important ,
(TUR,medium) I agree that successful people try new things and take risks . If some one would like to become bigger he should take risk because some obne does not know things work or not without trying . Even you doing some thing already know you have develop your way of doing and folow the modernism that brought by the age that we live . Every day needs of people and treatments toward the life are chanching . I would like to illustrate my opinion with an example . I would like to tell you about a simple farmer who was becoming the king of oil producer in Turkey . It is not important the name of the person but its is important the way that he done things . This person used to grow olive and sunflower in Izmir one of the biggest city in west Turkey . And he thought to produce olive and sunflower oil rather than sell his production . He could earn much if he produce oil from the plants that he growed . An d bought an old oil factory and started his own company . He worked day and night and won the belife of the consumer and growed and growed . The second of the person life wich also demonstrate the benefical site having risk to try new thing that . When the date showed late sixties people have started to chanche their way to buy oil . They before pereferred to buy 20 kg cans but now they buy 2 kg pet bins . So our hero see need of the new needs and bought some new machinery to produce the pet bins that the oil factory . Finially , I can say that if this person did not try new things to do , I thing he has still remained as a simple farmer .
(KOR,high) I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Though I think that the choice should be made depending on each person 's individaul personanlity and preference , there are more disadvantages of taveling in a group than traveling alone . For one thing , I believe that some people do not like being in a group . For those people . traveling in agroup will be very uncomfortable . I have many friends who do not want to be in a group . They may need more free time to relax and meditate by themselves . Second , traveling group people cannot decide where to go or what to eat on their own . They should cooperate with other members and somtimes they should give up their choices for the schedule of group . I have an example from my own personal experience . I was traveling in Italy in a group with a guide . The guide asked which restaurant people wanted to enter for lunch . Malority of people wanted to have Italian Pizza while I wanted to have stake . I should have to give up stake becuase I was the only person who wanted it . If I had traveled alone , this kind of thing would never have happend . Third , moving in group cannot as fast and efficient as moving alone . For example , people should wait until all the members get together and it is not easy to find space for many people in restaurant or theaters . One of friends told me her terrible experienc of travel . When she traveld China in a group , one of the members was lost in the Great Wall and all the other people wasted time finding the person and they gave up rest of schedule . But I also admit that traveling in a group led by guide have some advantages . For example , I do not have to study how to travel or what to prepare because the guide will do it for me . I do not have to worry what if I am lost , either . But more research on the traveling country will give me more sense of achievement after finishing traveling . Traveling in a group led by a tour guide involves a lot of disadvantages , less free time , less options to chose and less efficiency of movement . Though it can be more convenient to be led by a guide , one should sacrifice those things for convenience . Lastly , I believe that completing traveling by oneself will give him or her more sense of achievement with more exposure to the country they travel . So , I cannot agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
(TUR,high) I firmly believe that , in the twenty-first century , specializing in a specific subject is much more important than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects . This is for the reason that with developing technology and the accumulated knowledge of humankind through centuries , having broad knowledge on any subject is not sufficient to make researches , experiments or , consequently , any developments . It is known that Aristo worked on various branches of science from psychology to biology and physics . However , when the circumstances of the Ancient Greek civilization is compared to those of 20th century it will be quite clear why Einstein did not follow the footsteps of Aristo and merely , specialized in Physics . In Aristo 's era , humanity had not developed at all and was living its early stages . In this context , Aristo had the opportunity to bringforth the most basic concepts which were valuable then , but are a part of our daily life , now . Considering the technological conditions and the level of the knowledge of humanity , Einstein conceived that in order to step up he should focus on a single subject . Because being a member of the 20-century-old humanity he should learn a subject by heart , not only the main topics related to it but also the very details . That is , learning physics is a stepping stone to learn modern or quantum physics . The general behaviour of the disciplines of science is supporting this idea . As the researchers continue and the developments are achieved new disciplines are born from an existing branch of science . Physics was just physics at all , but as it is understood that there is something more to it , Electronics , Mechanics , Metallurgy etc. began to be considered as different branches . To sum up , I should say that I agree with the idea of knowing single subject but being the expert of that field , is far more better than having broad knowledge of many subjects which is identical to being able to talk of many subjects at first but is not able to keep pace with the real experts of that particular subject . It should not be disregarded that every effective person in today 's world , whether a politician , an academic person , soldier or a sportsman is specialized in single subject and that is why the people around the world know them .
(KOR,medium) We can think about many ways to study our academic subjects . One way is to make one 's knowlege of several academic subjects broaden , and another one is to concentrate on specific subject . I think the former ways are the better . The reasons why I think so are as follows ; First , modern society is very complex and difficult to understand by a narrow width of knowleges about a certain academic concern . The aspect of technogical improvement and changed social environment force us to know things with more broaden and open sights . For example new genetic technologies need us to study not only genetics but also chemistry , bioloy and so on . Second , to have broad knolwege of many subjects can help us to view things more accuratetly . If we know only some field and not know any other thing , then we cannot figure out what 's going on in our society . If you do n't know economics because you do n't have interst in that field , you cannot undestand why national economy is less active . Another example . Some parents have difficulty in explaining some easy scientific phenomenons for their children , It may lead their childeren to lose their interst in science and they cannot know our surroundings . Third , knowledges of a field can be linked to other fields ' knowledge ultimately . Economy is related to polictics . So we have to know and learn various things in academic fields . Thus , I think we need to learn various fields
(FRE,medium) For some people , you will suceed in your life just by taking risks . And it is right , in a certain way . In fact , our society shows admiration for these kinf of people . But we have to go deeply in this field to demostrate another side of this way if living . First of all , let us consider in which way taking risk could be a good strategy . If you are used to take risks by trying new things , you will become more and more famous . In that respect , our society are prouded of these behaviours of sorts . For example , you do n't have passed your exams when you were young . But you succeed in building your own business . Then , journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take . Thanks to these articles , you will become famous . Due to these sides , this strategy seems very attractive . But , some people , in order to become more and more famous , will take too much risks . people who adopt this strategy have to be very carreful . On the other and , we trend to forget negative sides of this strategy . Actually , if you take risk to succeed in your life , it would induce issues such as financial issues . For instance , you own a shop . You have to finance this shop , by getting a lot of money on it . If this shop does n't work in the long run , you would have debts . It may lead to financial issues with your bank . According to me , it is a lack of consciousness , especially when you are in charge of a family . This argument is far from being useless . When you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life , you must be awared of this . To sum up , I ca n't help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy . As far as I am concerned , I am convinced that some people should try this strategy because of their nature . The others sould carry on their habits of living .
(ARA,high) Life is so diverse , that as much as a person learns throughout his/her life , there is always more . There does not exist a limit for learning , and new discoveries and creations pop up daily in our everyday news , growing in a parallel mode with the ever imrpoving technology . As a matter of fact , a successful person is not one who knows a lot , but one who knows how , when and where to apply his/her knowledge in the best way available . A person who has mastered something ( X ) he/she does , is automatically better qualified to do and improve ( X ) than someone who has never seen or heard about it . Each human being has specific characteristics and environmental cultures that bound his/her ability of the things he/she has learned . Sometimes , these limits are highly disadvantageous , yet they would not make this person specifically unsuccessful , because with the right knowledge at one specific task , he/she can sublime in a way even the best educated person on the globe could not . On the other hand , trying new things and taking new risks are very important in today 's world , but it does not yet make it more successful a person who does it than one who does not . In fact , innovations and risks should always be tried for newly developed ideas and for the person to improve his/her skills and learn about most things a little . This concept is very well illustrated when compared to how the agricultural revolution evolved as an example . Imagine if a farmer would have to plant all types of fruits and vegetable , that at the end would barely be sufficient for his family survival in contrast to every one farmer specializing in a specific fruit or vegetable and than barter and trade with the others . Like that , each one farmer would definitely profit more with the specialization , and as a result also consume the best quality goods altogether . This shows that sometimes it is also benefitial to specialize in a specific ability to have the best results , because if everyone would like to do everything by himself the world would not go on . Now again , this does not mean that having some overall knowledge would be harmful . In conclusion , a successful person is a rather relative term . Because success can be attained with hard-work and loyalty to a goal . No matter the amount of risks and innovations taken , specializing yourself can be equally granted . Have you ever imagined if professional athletes stopped playing basketball , football , or baseball , would they still be successful ?
(SPA,high) STUDENTS SHOULD RELY IN FACTS AND NOT CONCEPTS After I graduated from high school , my physics teacher taught me all kind of concepts for algorythms and formulas . Later , at the university , when i was doing my internship , I look back and asked myself . Why I did not learned more didactic and practical things ? Facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life . Concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life . Actions demostrate ten times more than a single concept . A good idea is the one that it is made a reality . For example , let 's imagine that I am an engineer and I only know the concept to operate a machine . Can you imagine ? What am I going to do when I will be in front of my boss and tell him , `` I only know the concepts . '' It is ridiculous , to learn something without a logical meaning . Facts are the physical prove of a hypothesis or a project. a student can not learn just an idea , they need to know how to develop the concept . In particular When I was working in a manufacturing industry , we had to give our client his product . We could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it . Thus , it is important to be awarness of what a student is learning becuase if he does not , it is only an a waste of time . A student has to consider the facts instead of the ideas becuase it is the only way for the student to understand the purpose of a lesson . In particular , I enjoy taking classes at SECAP because they give a few theorical classes and the rest is useful practice which will help me in my career . It is clear , then that the ideas are just a vague imaginary actions that should be put into action . Hence , students and myself have to rely on the facts of every lesson , for those are the ones that really matter in our life and society . Between an idea and action , there is a process to work on .
(FRE,low) In my point of view , old peolpe are more happy of there life than young people . There are three reasons to this opinion . First , young people have a lot of problems . Then you study you have all the stress of the examination . Furthermore , it 's in this perdiod of life that you have to decidate of your future and you know it . You are conscient that all your decision will have a very big effect on your avenir . Second , older persons are more able to appreciate than the young generation . The oldest genaration have experience so they are more able to take in account what happen . They already achive something in there life so this people are more confidente . For exemple , when a 18 years old man felt in love we certanly not realise the chance that he have . On the over hand a 45 years old man realise exactly the chance that he have when he is in love . Finaly , although some people think that because students make more party they enjoy more there time . It 's well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at this party , covert only the problems of this persons . In conclusion , I will said that because of the too stressful situation that is accepted with alcool and the security and experience of old generation ; young people do n't enjoy life more than the older people do .
(SPA,high) The statement agreeing with having a broad knowledge and not a subject-specified knowledge is to one extent wrong . Having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects might be a positive thing but in the end there is the need of some kind of specialization in order to achieve and get some results . During the years of formation ( middle and high school ) a range of subjects is needed in order to give the student a chance to get a better idea on where they want to specify later on in their lives . But once school is over some kind of specialization needs to be required . Children and teenagers are required to learn no many subjects not because it is better to have a broader knowledge but because they are not old enough to choose which specialized subject they want to pursue . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is the same as having shallow knowledge on something . With this shallow knowledge no results can be achieved and the result , in the end , is someone that knows a little about everything and nothing about something specific . Engineers , doctors , lawyers are all specialized in their on subject . This professions that are the most respected ones are based on specific knowledge and not on broad knowledge . There is no time or real need for a doctor to know about law and how the judicial system works as long as he knows about his own profession and how to apply medicine . There is something called General Culture that everyone should learn and use in every day basis but it should not be the only knowledge a person has . The general culture should be accompanied by some kind of specified knowledge on something that would lead to something . People that only have general culture do not have enough knowledge to pursue a carreer that would lead somewhere in the future . The Nobel prizes , for example , are subject-specified and there is no General Culture Nobel Prize . The physicist that earns the Physics Nobel Prize has specified knowledge that accompanied with research and work in this subject led him to a discovery . In the end , what is needed in the world of today is a general sense of what is going in the world ( i.e. General Culture ) with some specified knowledge in a subject that might lead to an achievement that would help the world in general . Having only specified knowledge is also a negative thing because there is a dettachment of the real world that could harm a person and disconect him from the world .
(TEL,high) I do agree with the statements that succesful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . It is the calculated risk that a person takes that shows his confidence and attitude towards life . Trying out new things keeps a person from getting bored with the routine type of work . Taking new risks always has a chance for growth not only in what he/she is doing but also as a person . I can state my own experience as an example . I 've always been a topper in high school with excellence in mathematics . After graduating from high school most were taking up engineering and accounts for undergraduation . I realised I had an interest in sciences and dared to take the risk to face the competion to enter into a medical school . Finally not only did I get into one of the top medical schools with 98.5 % but also got a financial aid . All through the way I believed in myself and never let my confidence fall apart . And then I realised that I had a taste for music , which led me to become a Disc Jockey . I used it as a way to relax my tensions from my academic curriculum . People thought how can a ` ld be doctor possibly be a DJ . Well , I know it sounds weird , but I wanted to try someting new . It was just the start and the list went on from organising Medical Camps , Awareness campaigns to starting a student organisation for sincerity , service and development . Although you need discipline , hardwork and patience to reach goals , it is the difference which you make that matters . It shows the attitude towards life and the confidence with which we move ahead . Successful people are confident people with a positive attitude who try out something new always and try to make a difference in others ' lives . Every new task is a challenge for proficiency and confidence . They always want to see life in a broader prespective filled with challenges . As a matter of fact , everybody should try out new things , which will develop their attitude towards life and will make them a better person .
(GER,high) In my opinion , history shows that people that take risks and try new things are more successful that those that prefer to rely on their existing knowledge . There are several reasons and examples that support my point of view . First , in our globalized world , knowledge and technological innovations are rapidly increasing . Ten years ago , nobody used the internet . Today it is almost impossible to be successful without knowing how to write an email and how to surf in the internet . Therefore , it is necessary to be open to new inventions and changes in societies in order to make progress . Moreover , inventions have normally been made because people started to try new things and to take risks . A musician that only plays the songs he already manages quite well is n't very likely to invent a new song or to improve his interpretation . Only by trying out alternative interpretations , even though it may sound odd in the first place , new ideas may come to the musician 's mind . Consequently , his interpretation of the song can be improved . Therefore , by taking the risk of leaving behind old patterns of thinking , previously unknown concepts can be found out . In addition , people that take the risk of starting a business with a new concept may have more success than those that sell established products . Although franchising , for example , gives the shopowner more security , the possibilty of making huge surpluses is lower . Enterly new and creative concepts , however , can help you to become really successful . In conclusion , taking risks and trying new things contributes to make people successful . Due to globalization , society changes rapidly , so that you are required to broaden your horizon in order to succeed . Furthermore , the possibilities of making a new discory and to run a successful business are higher . Thus , I prefer to do new things and to take risks .
(HIN,high) I disagree with the given statement that in the coming twenty years the number of cars on road will actually decrease . Many people may believe and support this because of the fact that petroluem resources are depleting and the sudden rise in prices of petrol and diesel have supported their point of view . But what they actually fail to see is the facts . As of today we have not even discovered ( leave alone taking out ) 50 % of the petroluem resources present on earth . The theory or curve used for energy consumption is Logistic curve . This curve shows that energy consumption reaches to a maximum value at exactly the mid point of the life span of the resource . Till today we have not reached that mid point even . Another point is that , the rate at which the automobile sector is growing today it is impossible to say that in the next twenty years it will be gone . All the big industries can not be closed in just twenty years . Coming back to the petroluem , it is true that the cost of oil will continue to increase and slowly it will not be affordable for the commom man to use it for transportation but other alternatives are coming up slowly . They include Bio-fuel , coal gasification and coal liquification , etc .. I have myself worked on Bio-fuels ( specifically bio-diesel ) . In my project I used bio-diesel as fuel for a diesel engine and compared engine performance and emission characterstics with diesel on other hand as fuel . The conclusion was that bio-diesel produces less pollutants and is cheaper as compared to diesel prices as of today . Moreover it is bio-degredable . The researchers are having lot of hopes with bio-fuels because of above mentioned advantages . In my country government has taken several initiatives for mass-production of bio-diesel . There are other alernatives for petroluem also . eg. For the short term requirement of petrol/diesel and gas , coal liquification and coal gasification are best possible answers . In these processes solid coal is converted to natural gas and liquid petrol . As there is no scarcity or crisis for coal today , this will be a possible answer for some years . Also much research is going on on electric cars . Indian company REVA is producing an electric car called REVA II which is available for consumers . Hence in all it is evident that the number of cars on road will only increase but the rate of increase may drop down . And the problem of energy crisis will be solved because human civilization will survive as it has till date and whenever such problems come , alternatives have been found out and implemented .
(CHI,high) Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do . Other people believe in the other way which is older people have a more enjoyable life than young people . As far as i concern , the latter is more reasonable than the idea mentioned earlier for the following reasons . In the first place , young people have more responsibilities , which would allow them have less time to enjoy the wonderful things in their lives , than elderly , As a older people , in a sense , there is no duty , such as rising a child , paying taxes , and educate the next generation ; on the contrary , these responsibilities are , now , weighted on the shoulders of younth . They need to worry about many things , including how to hold their jobs . And it is also the truth that an increasing amount of time is being spent in the work place in order to hold the position they hold now . That means less and less time will be available for them to enjoy the life . In the second place , older people have a more peaceful mind to enjoy the life . These is a growing tendecy for people to lose their ambition as their age is going up . Comparing to the young people , elderly feel more comfortable with the life they are having now ; unlike older people . young people are always on the way to seek something better , something they think deserve better . This makes them always on the process of chasing , leaving no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are having now . Finally , older people can do numberous things that young people are not able to do . With the repect for older people taking more and more important place in an increasing number of people , people now build many places only for old people , and make more entertainments for the older . These programme are more suitable for elders . That 's reason some of the shows can not be understood by the young people . All in all , young people cant not enjoy their life as much as older people do beacuse they are having less time , and ambitous mind to chase others thing . In addition , they ca n't understand something that elders do . However , i believe that in the future , young people will enjoy life in a same amount that older people do .
(TEL,high) I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . This is seriously observed in urbanised communities than in rural comunities . The possible reason why young people nowadays spend less time in helping their communites could be their tight and hectic schedules . The education system these days is really challenging the students . It is not that easy to get through such a process of education because of the severe competition among the young students . The students cannot afford to leave the education system responsibilites for the sake of community requirements . if they dont concentrate much on their education they will have to regret at the poor grades they score and the poor performance they had given . This would affect their future . They would n't get enough or suitable employment opportunites . Usually , a student with good educational qualifications get enough opportunities to lead their professional life satisfactorily . The other possible reason could be the change of mindset of the students these days . The present day students lack the quality of helping nature . This could have been resulted from the severe competition from their counterparts . So , students have turned selfish . They dont show concern for the development of the fellow-student because of the fear that they might overtake . For example , in a university there are limited number of seats . Obviously all those who are aware of the fact keep it confidantial and do not show concern for others because of the fear that the university seats get exhausted . A similar kind of attitude is more seriously observed among the employees of a company . An employee is reluctant towards his co-employee or he doe n't show any concern to help him because of the fear that the opther person might overtake . The reason for this kind of behaviour among the people is the lack of enough number of opportunities . So , for all these reasons , the pesent day students neither concentrate much on community affairs nor contribute for the community welfare .
(ARA,medium) Every one of the people around the world belong to a spicific community . and he or she thus has different commitment towards his or her community . we are parts of our community and can not detach from it or give it up . all the three level of ages children , youngs , adults , and olds should help thier community as much as they can do . when we take a certain stage like youngs , we can notice that they really do not give a lot or even enough time for serving their communities . and i think this is arised from several reasons including that those youngs are only concerned with thier own pleasures and entertaintments . in which they spent a lot of money to ride a new car or to buy a new expensive mobile phone or new cloths or to even gain a new pritty girlfriend . Thier lifstyle is some what changed , they dont ever think of other inneed people to help them , or cleaning thier nighberhood , or fixing some broken public places or seats , or teaching childerin , or preventing some bad habits like smoking and taking drugs and drinking alcohols . non of that could be done from them . one of other reasons include that all the people inside the community are apart from each other . in which parents do not teach , learn or arise thier childerin of loving other people and they arise them for being a speciall or unique persons . persons who gain money and spent it on his or her self . in conclusion these days are really hard on our community and we have to do something to solve this problems . and that can only be done by increasing the education of loving our community . and help any person who need that . and every one who refuse must be punished .
(SPA,medium) Idea Over Fact The concepts and ideas that are essential in the learning procees of any academic proffesion have to understand , and not memorized . The learning process implies a thought , ration , and analysis ; all of them essential in the absorption of information into our brains . I agree with this statement because the understanding of all those concepts will beter prepare me in my proffesion . I believe that the facts come as a direct result of the concepts and ideas that are learned in the academic prepation for a career . We would not have facts if it was not for especific sciences like mathematics , chemistry , and physics . A fact is only a series of numbers of a certain event or people . That are thrown by the person that does the recolection process of information to do statistics . With out the process of understanding the concepts and ideas of a science we would not be able to create facts . For example we could be able to count or do statistics without mathematics . Another perspective of facts is that we do not know if the facts are true or not ; the facts can be manipulated by personal or monetary interest . For example a pharmaceutical company may manipulate facts of a certain disease - to increase sales of the medicine that cures that particular disease - to create a highers revenues on the financial statements . I am not saying that facts are not important . I use facts all the time in my profession and job . But , we do not have to make facts the foundation of our knowledge in this world . A fact when it is given as an honestly , errorless , and doubtless source , it wil automatically become a most useful tool in our day-to-day life . The better understanding of ideas and concepts will make better facts and staticstics in the near future .
(ITA,high) I am not agree with this sentence . In fact nowadays , the number of the people in the world who can attend the school is in costant grown , and this produce an increasing number of people who are able to learn and understand the problems connected with the world and the human beings . Many people are able to have access to the mass media , such as the television , the radio or , I think the most important , internet . So this access to information creates a great number of people who can help their community . Many critics belive that our society is too frenetic , too fast and makes us indifferent to the problems of the world . But I believe that this point of view is not correct . In fact this society gives us the instruments to resolve problems , not only with the increasing economic benefits , but with the consciousness of the important of human rights in order to make our world better . So the real problem is not if young people have enough time to help their society , but if they want to do it . It is clear that only with the time young people will be able to understand that personal benefits must be accept only if they can improve the life conditions of the whole world . Becouse it is wrong if a man thinks that his education will help only his personal life or his family , because he is part of a large community that is not identify with his particular town or contry , but it is part of a whole , that is the world . People must be the aim to help men that are not in their same conditions , becouse the purpose of the whool educational system in our society is to make the world better . So I believe that people who understand this need can really help our community and this is not a problem of time but of responsability . I guess that governments have to work in this sense to ma
(JPN,medium) In my opinion , I feel that the opinion is preferable that understanding ideas and concepts are more significant than learning facts for students because of several reasons . First , it would not be interesting to learn facts too much . By teaching for students ideas and concepts , the students would be getting interested in the subject which is facts more . For example , for my case , I did not like Biology because it seems so difficult for me . When I read about biological textbook , I gave up reading soon after I started to read the book . However , during the biology class , my biology teacher showed us familiar examples and some ideas and concepts . After the class , I could read the textbook once I gave up before without thinking that it is difficult . It was quite interesting . Because of the teacher , now I like biology and in the future I would like to get job that is related to biology . Due to this case occured for me before , I think it is more important to understand them rather than to learn facts . Second , it is going to be very debatable if the students received an education about ideas and concepts more than facts . It means that both the teachers and the students enjoy the classes because the students would suggest many opinions against the ideas and concepts . I think it encourages the teachers to teach something . It is because if the teachers teach fact too much and do n't teach concepts , the students would not be able to understand about facts , and they would not pay attention about the topic . For teachers , it should be avoidable thing . Third , the process to understand ideas and concepts are quite significant than understanding facts . It let students to think about something , so they can state their own opinion . It is really important to have your own opinion today 's world , so I agree the idea . Facts are important too , but you ca n't actually learn without understanding ideas and concept for anything .
(GER,high) I am convinced that it is beneficial to specialize in one specific academic area once a general understanding of other areas is achieved . If we look back into history , we can find many scientists that were great in a wide variety of subjects . Today , this cannot be achieved anymore . While back then , there were still many things to be discovered and it was possible to have a broad knowledge of and do research in different academic fields , today 's scientists have to specialize to be able to do research on a specific topic . And this research can be very important to society , leading to a better understanding of topics . For example , without research it would be impossible to find cures for diseases . Now nobody could do medical research before specializing in this specific area . I agree that it is important to know about a variety of things . In fact , the public school system should provide a core understanding of science , arts and humanities . But on a professional level we need to specialize in order to be successful . This is easier to explain when looking at music . Would you rather listen to someone that can play drums , the guitar , the piano and the violine , but is not great at neither of them or listen to someone play one of these instruments with perfection ? One person also can only play one instrument at a time . Look at the Dave Matthews Band , `` America 's greatest band '' , as the Rolling Stone magazine judged . All members know their instrument to near perfection . That is the main reason for their popularity and their sold-out tours year after year , not the fact , that they are able to play all instruments equally well . This also applies to many other areas . Another great example are sports . A football team needs players that are specialized in throwing , catching , running , blocking etc .. Of course it is important and even necessary for every player to have a basic understanding of the game , but if you want to be successfull you need to have players that are great at their assignments . Overall , a linemen put into the position as place kicker would most likely lead to a catastrophy . All these examples show that , while learning about the basics of different subjects , it is important to find out where your special talents are , to pursue them and specialize in them .
(KOR,medium) I agree with the statement that most advertisemens make poeple to think those products are much better than what they are . In these days , we can see the advertisements on the TV about the games . Most of elementary , junior high school , and high school students have a game machine in their house . Advertisement gives an idea that those games really nice and fun , but in reality , they play with that game no longer than three months . Moreover , people spend too much time on the game than school work , which causes the problems that students do not do their homework at home . Furthermore , when we see the advertisement of drinks and sweets , we go buy it , because they are advertising as it will take away our thirstyness and hungry . In reality , it is not healthy and it will cause more damages in our body . which can be very harsh for patients who stays in their home with out doctors and nurses . In my case , I saw a advertisement on the shopping mall about the jean that is really comfortable and cheap . I had no doubt about it because it was very famous company , so I believed what they were saying . Whein I bought and brought my house , it was n't that pretty that i expected and it was n't comfortable than what I thought . I thought that i just should keep for the future , but then I changed my mind to return it . when I brought that jean to the mall , they said , its not refundable . I told them that there is no sign about return policy , but it was on the pomplet that i saw before i buy the jean . They put a statement that all sales products are not refundable with small font . I could n't believe that they did n't put that policy in the front of the pomplet with little bigger font . Most advertisements ca n't be trusted because they are advertising their products to make more money and profits .
(FRE,high) In order to answer this question thouroughly , we first need to define what we mean under the words `` understanding '' and `` learning '' . A student has understood an idea once he is able to explain it with his or her own words , to provide examples and to link the idea to other ideas . He should also be able to compare it or to constrast it with other ideas . Learning , on the other hand , refers to factual knowledge that can be acquired by means of memory . Given the definitions above , one can easily imagine that understanding concepts requires more skills than just knwing facts by heart . Sutdents will need to think further , to analyze and to link oncepts together when they understand them . For example , in order to understand the literary movemement called `` naturalism '' , students will need to distinguish it from realism and to have an idea of what is determinism . Learing facts about naturalism would not allow students to really grasp the main point about it . They would be able to name naturalist writers such as Stephen Crane or Jack London , eventually to provide a definition learnt by heart , but not to place the movement in its literary context . Another important advantage of understanding is that it creates a structure in the mind that can be reapplied in many different domains . Once a students understands how a mechanical feature of the car , he will be able to understand the mechanical feature of many other cars , even if they differ . It is basically the same principle . Learning , on the other hand , always needs to be done again and again because it is specific to one thing . I agree that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . However , a good student who does not have any factual knowledge is not a student . A student of Swiss history has to know that Switzerland was founded in 1291 . Usually , a thourough , complete understanding cannot be separated from learning .
(ITA,medium) To say : `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' is a joke . Every year in this world the number of car circulating is increasing , new countries are developing , the work 's market needs more flexibility and everyone of us want to have the freedom of going wherever and whenever we want . If we think about China we can see that it 's trying to follow the first world with its economy so we can imagine that in the future they will follow our manners so probably they will wish as us a car for ownself and a car for their childs . If that happen the number of the cars will be necessarily higher than now . In addition the number of people living on earth is going to become bigger and so everyone will have his owncar . Another problem that can increase the cars ' number is that very often the public transport system is not very useful because there are not rides during the night or the frequency of the rides is not enough or the trains and buses are so busy and owercrowded that can be a real challenge to cach them . In addition , as happen very often in Italy ( as today ) , the public transport is not available because the workers do n't go to work to protest with the government or with the employers On the other hand the number of available parking will be ever fewer and so that can be a deterrent to reduce the cars . In addition the request of fuel will be too much higher ( increased by the cars ' number ) and as ever happen in the market the petrol price will be so high that someone will have to leave his own car at home using public transport .
(FRE,medium) Since the end of the nineteen century , the expansion of cars is increased all over the years . The need to move from a town to another or the pleasure of driving had produced a big market and economic system . Could you imagine the evolution in a few years ? What could be the number of cars in twenty years ? In fact , the real question is if the cars will be fewer or not in the next years . Firstly , we live in an economic system based a lot on the petroleum industry . The main energy of cars , today , is the petrol . Have fewer cars in a few years would say we need to be more independant about this energy and develop other sorts of energy . The decrease of the number of cars will be possible only with economical changes and also policy reglementation . Secondly , our road network is sometimes saturated . I ca n't imagine where we could put the others cars into the traffic jams . We can imply to build other roads . But this ca n't be indefinitly . Now we could in this term have some cars additionaly but in a way , it has to stop a day . End thirdly , people are more and more sensitive to the environment . Lot of them go to work in common transports or in bicycle . People had some cars but do n't use it in the same way than few years ago . The cost of cars are also a barrer , not only the aquisition but also the training on it . People do n't want cars or ca n't buy them . To conclude , I hope that in twenty years , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that 's why I hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transports like bus , tramway , metro and so on . I think also that people are ready to change their cars culture . In fact it is now the decision of a pollution way or an oxygen way for our planet .
(FRE,high) On the one hand , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a tremendous asset because we can say when we apply for a job that we are polyvalent . This is well valued by employers because we will be able to evoluate in many different fields , services in the firm . Many business schools deliver marketing , financial , linguistic skills which can be used in different posts in a firm . And this is a security for students who do not have a specific project for the future . But after all those advantages , there is one major drawback which is that the student only know few things about many subjects . Indeed , only basics skills can be treated when this is not a specialized subject . So the student will be penalize against a specialized student . On the other hand , to be specialized in one specific subject is the best choice for students who have a clear idea of what job they want to exerced in the future . They can say to the employers that they are the best in one particular subject . This is very good way to apply for a job . Firms need the best . Multinational firms put in competition students over the world , so being specialized in finance when you want to apply for a job at Price Water and House is required . Its is impossible for someone who have only basic skills in Audit . The disadvantage is that if the company wants to put us in an other service , which is not our specialisation , we will have to do trainings , formation , or at least to learn alone with our own experience . This is more stressful and very risked . So this a thorny problem for a student . To tackle this issue , we have to compare the strenghts and weaknesses of each education like I have done . There is one solution adapted to each cases . Then , we have to know if a job in specific interest us . If this is the case , we have to specialized in the subject appropriated to apply for this job . Anyway , in our studies , we are never totally specialized in something . There is always a few basic skilled mastered . And this is a good thing because polyvalence if very appreciated by employers .
(GER,medium) Younger and older people have differnt ways to live their lifes but it seems to me that younger people can enjoy their way of living more than older people can . That is why I agree with the the statment . On reason is , that I think that young people are more unconscious than older peolpe and that is why they are more free in taking advantage of what is going on in front of them . For example if hey have the opportunity to go and visit a friend in another country they often do not thing how hard it is to go there . They just take a few things and try to reach their friends place , maybe by hitch hiking . This mostly differes from the behaviour of older people , which often have to plan things in a really organized way . And often have all this thouhgts like is this the right moment in my life , what about my job ... This feels like , that young people have a big amount of freedom to act however they want A other reason why young people can enjoy their lifes more is , that they do not have the same amount of responsibillities like older people . They do not have children to look for . They can go to a party the whole night long without having lots of stress the next day . They only need to go to school . Young people often are more healthy then older peoples , so they can do a lot of things older people cannot do , for example extrem - sports According to all the other reasonable things about this topic I would think , that the main point why young peoples enjoy life betteris , that they still have freedom to choose what they want to do , without beeing trapped in an adult life .
(TUR,high) The invention of the vehicle is one of the most significant achivement of the twentieth century . They made the long distances shorter and provided time efficiency . Today , cars are the most common kinds of vehicles . Every individual might buy a car depending on their needs. t must be stated that selling rate of cars are getting increased due to the curiousity of people , the advancements on cars and the population growth of the earth . Therefore , while there are technology improvements on cars and rapid population spead over , I disagree with the statement that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . To begin with , the technology is reaching further in any area and the area related to cars , so I do not think that in near future there will be fewer cars in use . The technology improves cars far beyond . Every year we are being advertised about new things on cars such as brake systems and some protections for children . For Example twenty five years ago there have not been an ABS ( Automatic Brake System ) system but now we have that technology . I personally had chance to experience this sytem in our own car . One day I was driving car and suddenly a child appeared , I quickly pushed to the brake and thans to the ABS system I did not hit to child . Consequently I do believe that while the advancements on cars continue , it is low possibility that in near future there will be less cars in use . In addition , the population of the world is increasing every single one of day , so I see this factor as one of the reasons not to decrease the amount of cars in use in near future . Accordingly population growth is a problem that must be solved . There are starving people in Afica . So I do believe that it is not good because the resources are limited . on the other hand , it is good for selling new cars . Because every individual means potential customer . So looking in this perspective while human beings are increasing and spreading all over the world , it is not possible that the amount of the cars reduce . For example researches show that , comparing the car selling rates with the past thirty years it is consistently increasing every year . In conclusion , in the light of the facts I stated above , I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I consider there might be people who agree with that statement . However in my opnion my reasons are crucial and essential for me . Therefore in my opinion in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there today .
(ITA,low) I disagree with the statement because It is not allways true . Infact there are many young people that do not know the real meaning of `` enjoy life '' . They like drink alchool and smoke or take drugs . This two things are all that they would like to enjoy their life . But I know many old people that know what it is the felicity . Firstly they appreciate the slowly of life , the kindness and the importance of friends . They know the meaning of drink a tea whit friends . Also they can dancing an walking like nobody know . Lastly they know the meaning of life , but If it is not true anyway they will know how enjoy their life ! According to a magazines in the future there will more old people than young people . I think that it will be good because If the old people know how enjoy life , all the world will be happy . There are , also , a lot of cultural difference between people . For this reason it is impossible to know how the world will be . If you have a zero cultural backgound and you live in a country you will know the felicity , but if you have a kind knowledge that it is not complete you will unhappy . In both of this two examples you do not know your grade of happyness
(GER,medium) First of all I have to mention , that the statement does not give any details about the age or profession of a person . I think that the advantages and disadvantages of a broad knowledge just apply regarding to the state of socialization of an individual . A broad knowledge has a lot of advantages in todays world . I would even say , that a broad knowledge is nessecary in our world of globalisation . We live in a multiculturell and globalised world . That causes a damage to the individuality of a country . Kulture , religion and knowledge get mixed up . Since the globalisation supports communication the broad knowledge is increasing rapidely . Globalisation causes fusions of firms . Combined firms need people with a broad knowledge and the ability to combine different subjects rather than knowing everything about a specific topic . On the other hand it is nessecary for every company to have specialists in each field . For example : The IT section in germany does not have a lot of good qualified specialists . So the german gouverment applies for IT specialist from India and Pakistan . Germany wou't be able to meet the world-wide average knowlegde in information technics without the help of those specialists . My opinion is , that it is nessecary to have a wide spread knowledge as a young person to be able to be flexible in a multiculturel civilization . On the other hand I have to admit that every succesful company needs people with specialized knowledge to create knew knowledge . I come to the final decision neither to agree nor to disagree with the statement , since I believe that it isdependant on the age and spacific field of an individual whether the knowledge has to be more broad or no
(HIN,high) We all are interested in reading about cars and dream of owning a car . It is one of the first few items that we plan to buy if someone asks us what we would do if we win a lottery ? If we observe the recent trend in car manufacturing , the demand for cars is ever growing . I dont think there is any chance that people will stop using cars in years to come . Infact I feel that in twenty more years , this craze of buying a car is going to multiply even further and there will be more cars in use than there are today . Twenty years is a very less time span to let go off a luxury like owning a car . Owning a car has become a status symbol . People want to own a car just beacuse it improves their standing in the society . In less developed countries , the level of noise and air pollution created by the use cars is unbeleivable . Laws and regulations have little effect on the demand for cars in these countries . Car manufacturing industry is a huge industry with a turn over of millions of dollars per month all over the world . Who would possibly give up such a profitable business ? Instead we are going to see more number of new and new cars & more number of commercials attracting people to buy these cars in coming years . People are not going to stop using cars overnight . So many factors come into play when we talk about not using cars . The governments will have to improve the public transport to a level wherein people will prefer travelling by public commute rather than using a car . That looks like a distant possibility in some nations . Modern technology has invaded our lives to a level where man finds it difficult to survive without it . Cars , cellfones , television sets , music systems , washing machines , refrigerators and other such things have become a part of our life . We cannot think about living a life which lacks in the comforts given by these modern machines . Car is just one of the many things man has created for his own comfort . Man has failed to realise that these machines are causing more harm than their known uses . These modern machines have ruined our earth 's atmosphere and oneday will lead us to extinction . If we want to survive , we will have to take one big step towards minimising the use of these machines specailly cars that cause so much of pollution .
(JPN,medium) I think that helping one 's community means taking part in the community actively . Therefore , if given the choice , I think that yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . There are two reasons . First , young people nowadays are very busy . For example , I would like to think about junior high school students in Japan . They go to junior high school , of course . After school , almost all of them go to cram school . They have to prepare for the entrance examination of high school . They ca n't come back to their home until 10 p.m or so . They do n't have opportunities to meet their neighbors day time and know what kind of people are in their community . They do n't have sense enough to feel living in the community . Second , young people tend to enjoy their free time in thei home even if they have much time . These days , there are many enjoyable goods which you are alone . One example of this is the Internet . With using the Internet , you can communicate with not only your close friends but also people in the all over the world you have never seen . The Internet makes you decrease the opportunities to meet someone face to face . Taking part in the activities held by community and touching your neighbors make your community more powerful and cheering . But young people do n't go their community because of being busy and atractive goods in their home . As a result , I think young people do n't help their community .
(FRE,medium) I think that it will effectively have fewer cars in use in the future than we can meet today . I feel this way because i believe that many factors will make us to let our cars at home . From ourselves , from the nature , but also from the states . First , i consider that an auto pollutes a lot and if we continue to pollute our world , like we have already done through the ozone hole for exemple , we wo n't be able tu live on earth without bad changements . That 's why i think that people will do something from themselves in order to help the nature staying good for us . They will for exemple prefer to walk because they will understand that if everyone make something , it wo n't have little signals . Another reason i believe that thre will be fewer cars in twenty years it that the states of al countries will do something against cars like they begin to do nowadays . for exemple the days without cars . Furthermore , we are seeing that more and more ways to drive bike or to take buses ans undergrounds are built in order to make people let their cars at home . And i think that if the states do something , the population will have to use teses ways . And then , the reason i would like to emphasize is the fact that it will have a lack of petrol on the earth and the humankind will have to find another type of things to move such as we have already showed ( underground for exemple ) . So , if even the nature does n't give much power for the cars anymore we will have to reduce our use of cars . As i have stated , i believe that many ways from ourselves , from the state and most important from the nature make us to use not so often . It will continue in the future that 's why i tink there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years
(CHI,high) Yes , I totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . It is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder because there are too many advertisements present their products in the most attractive ways . I think the reason is that there are many companies and manufactures out there making the same type of products . Therefore , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive . And due to the advanced technologies those advertisement agencies use , almost every product they present looks like the best on the market . But very often , consumers do n't really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ads . For example , few weeks ago I saw a digital camera ad on FRY 's Electronics that was offering a great discount on this featuring model . It the picture , the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built . Although I owned a professional digital SLR camera ( by CANON ) for a while , I wanted soemthing inexpensive , small , and easier to carry around in the campus . I purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store . When I took it home , I realized its body was not metal but some light ; cheap plastic . The fully charged battery died with in just 30-40 minutes of photo shooting after trying it . I finally got frustrated and decided to return it . The return line was very long and the guy behind me was returning the same camera too due to the same reason . We talked for more than 30 minutes while waiting and we reached a conclusion that never purchase something just based on the ad or picture . From now on , I do studies online or read some consumer reviews before I purchase . Even the old saying goes `` A picture worths more than a thouthand words '' , it does n't apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays .
(TUR,medium) The traffic , the huge amount of cars in the ways or streets and the problem of road travel is being discussed for many years . It is wanted to be solved and to solve this many solutions are developed . I do n't think this problem will be solved in twnety years and i do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . There are two reasons why i think like this . First reason i think the manufacturing never stops . I mean the manufacturing of the vehicles such as cars buses which carry people one place to another and occupy the roads . The firms produce many many vehicles every year and there is an absence of the rules about the older cars . Furthermore , older cars can be the main problem about traffic . The newer ones fill the roads every year , every months and even every day . In contrast , the solution is being thought that underways , undersea travel , metros , railways and sea travel may be considered to reduce the traffic jam and so do the number of cars in use . But i do n't think it is enough . Secondly , people usually choose their own vehicles to travel beacuse of many reasons , For example they may want more comfortable travel by their own vehicles and moreover it may be cheaper than the others . Besides , the trains , for instance , carry many many passanger in a day , however these many people can disturb each other when they are in the train . Therefore , there may be little decrease in the number of the cars . To sum up , there are two reaons i mentioned above that it ca n't be possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years with todays technology . Besides , the firms have to produce more and more cars to exist and the people will always like comfort and their own cars . On the contrary ; may be flying cars can change my mind if it is possible to manufactured .
(SPA,high) The question about whether it is better to have a broad knowledge or to be specialized is very controversial . One may argue that it is preferable to be familiar with as many subjects as possible , since this will lead to be better suited to different situations . On the other hand , there is the claim that since human knowledge is so broad that it is not only impossible but unpratical to avoid specialization . As a final position , I 'll argue why nowdays its better to specialized . In paticular , I will illustrate this by explaining the situation of nowdays mathematicians . First I would like to explain why to have a meaninful broad knowledge is almost impossible . By meaninful knowledge , I understand an amount suited to do reasearch on a specific subject or make contributions to it . Just considering the especific case of mathematics , nowdays it has become so broad that even a Master thesis may be hardly understood by people not specialized in the subject . So if someone is not specialized in any field , there are chances that he will not understand the state of the art of the mathematical sciences . Even , there is people who tries to specialized in every possible fields , and what generally happends is that the person becomes a very good lecturer but a poor researcher . My point is that mathematics is too broad to avoid specialization . So the aim of obtaining a broad mathematical knowledge will lead to someone that would hardly be able to excel as a researcher . This leads to my second argument . Nowdays an academic person is many times measured based on the amount of original results he produces . That means that not only the person is required to be on the edge of our knowledge , but aquainted enough with it so that to understand how to and be able to expand it . So in order to obtain a possition as a researcher is better for him to be specialized . And as a matter of fact , only a researcher can aim for a trully broad knowledge in a particular science . As a conclusion , given the fact that it is impossible to have and unpractical to aim for a broad knowledge in mathematics , it is even less desirable in general .
(CHI,medium) I disagree the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I will prove it in several examples below . there is a large amount of cars now and so many car company produce the car for busness . if there will be fewer car used in twenty years , the car company will encounter the disaster that thousands of car work will lose the jop . what the society can suffer the millions of work who lose the jop walking into government hall to fight . secondly the many famous company such as ford will bankrupt , in economical aspect , if so many big company bankrupt , the wealth the company make for the society will deline . this may cause the product to rise their amount that many low payment worker cannot aford to buy the daliy product . more people will suffer the pain . on the oher hand company will resarch the technology to decrease the pollution of cars instead of desdroying them . in the scientific aspect , scientist will satisfy the deman of envionment pollution by changing the gas we use to something like electrical battery or product which produce no pollution . though it is a hard work for the company and scientist to do , we believe the car without pollution will make the dream come true in a few years later and car are not decreasing , and even more people will buy the new scientifical car to drive . despite the many car company existing , the large number of worker can keep the jop and economy will rise becuse the worker who get jop buy goods . at the same time other industry will rise due to the demanding of car element such like , iron . the society benefit the car and will not let the car decrease .
(TEL,medium) SUCCESSFUL the word by itself describes people who does things taking risks I strongly agree that successful people certainly must have done things at risk rather than only doing what they already known I can support my statement with a couple of examples for instance Sunitha and Kalpana chawla the great two indians would certainly not be noticed in the Indian history as they have been the two only Indian women exploring into space if they had a thought of learning underneath and excelling in what they knew they might have certainly not been known to the world one can only excell in his knowledge by improving his own personal experiences but exploring out with risk will certainly find a way to him for succes All successful people should or might have certainly taken risk at one point or the other in the journey of success without out which it certainly be immpossibble . Trying for new things will enable one self in discovering things and bring him to the stage of success . Trying new things also makes oneself unique in the world and certainly they would have pride and a meaningful life lived . successful comes out primarily from the scientist experiment or invention . Yes certainly the scientist without a risk would not have been successful with his work any individual to be successful should be dare enough to face the new aspects and try new things then he would certainly not miss the step of success . one cannot have a satisfaction in his so called success without implementing certain new things if not that could only be for his self assesment . Sucessful people like George bush and Abdul kalam the presidents of America and India are known for there sucessful life they have tried upon new ammendments upon risk and could discover things . Every individual is not all perfect enough one can make themselves perfect by doing things so certainly successful people try new things and take risks rather than do what they already knew and always put their heads high and taking risks will be the only aspect to be successful .
(TEL,medium) According to the my point of view of the fact , ubiquoitus in my view . young people enjoy life , better when compared to older ones , because they had more opputunities to enjoy in a better way , in terms of various scientific inventions which paved the platform for indulgance in various activities . To substantiate my wordings i give the following reasons .. The young are more energitic , enthusiastic . The heated blood within them makes them more career oriented . According to the medical facts . people tend to go older in their in mind and body , as the age advances . to the older ones are more responsible in their acts , hence they pay deaf ear to such enjoying acts . On the contarary , the young are free from responsibilities . they depend not wholy on the old , but to the fact on some occasions like guidence .. they show various patterns of enjoyment , example , with friend to roam about , in disco `` s , in various cultural gatherisations . on the hold pepole when turn old donot show much interest in various outdoor source of enjoyments . but prefer to stay calm and cold . The young enjoy by the latest advancements in modern scientific technology , what i mean is the Television , internet , cell phones , automobiles , music , increased career oppurtunities led to the fulfillment of goals , which led to furthur enjoyment , pleasure , satisfaction in what ever they do . on the contrast olders ones , are more oriented in family development , mental peace , and various other activities which make them comfortable . Iorder to strenghten my facts . According to the current statistical medical records.70 % of the people recticated to vote that young enjoy better when compared to older ones .. Hence therefore , it is mandatory to stick to the vague fact that young enjoy more when compared to the older ones . But i stake to say that young ones enjoy better than old , but they have to enjoy with th older ones .
(SPA,medium) I do agree with the statement , but i can not be completely sure about it . It is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before . Also the polution shows a lot of economical and enviromental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using the cars because of their leck of usefulness in the cities . Oil prices is a principal problem for western countries which have n't their own oil supplies . For example in europe , it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes , insurances and enormous fuel costs . Also the leck of space in major cities make the price rise up . One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe , e.g. the goverment in Vienna is making biking routs in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its habitants . Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car . A city designer in London said that cars should n't design the city . He meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans . This statement has its truth , when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones . European cities have a natural structure . The old parts mostly the centers are n't designed for cars but more for humans . American cities like Caracas they have major problems with mobility of humans . Of course they have a metro but the cars made formed the appearance of the city . They have in the middle of the city big highways and it is completely impossible to walk from one point to the other .
(GER,medium) I agree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks are more successful than people who just stay on the level they are already on . In my opinion people who want to be successful should be creative and open for new things . Furthermore they should believe in themselves and should not get insecure , if other persons do not agree with their opinion or way of proceeding . For instance , many big inventions such as cars or planes would n't exist this time , if there would not have been somebody who was affected to new things , had the will to research and to take the risk of failing . Probably , when Daimler invented the first car most people thought he would be crazy and did not support his plans . He had the risk to fail , but as we can see today it turned out as a big invention and he became famous . However , if people would n't be risky and open-minded the human nature would n't be on this level it is right now . The society needs people who are interested in new things to develop and to grow up . If we all would stay on the level which we are good in and do not increase our abilities , we still would live in wooden houses as centuries ago .
(KOR,medium) Sompe people say it is much more beneficial to have the deep knowlege in only one specifie subjuct . In contrasts , others argue that it is much better to have broad knowledge of various academic sudjects . Even though , knowing subjuct deeply is advantageous , i want to be on the latter side . Because , it helps people to make many friends who are working in the different fields and it is also beneficial in raising babies . Firstly , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps ones to get along with many kinds of people . When we enter job fields , we have many opportunites to meet many kinds of people . Sometimes , we face scientists , doctors , musicians , or businessman . Let 's compare two people . The one knows lots of things in many fields and the other one knows only one thing he or she is interested . Who do you think can make friends if there is a party ? For sure , the former person wins in this situation . Because people get to know each other by having a conversation . Besides , it is also revealed in movie . The movie named `` Briget 's Diary '' , we can see the main actress is alone in the party because of her shallow knowledge . Secondly , it has many good points when parents raise their babies . Having broad knowledge is beneficial for both parents and childeren . Since , the academic skills are made in childhoods . If the parents know many things , for instance , in the fields of paiting , music , language , and so on , it is much easier for them to raise babies . Furthermore , it also creats a talented baby . Because parents can educate them by themselves since they are young . In conclusion , i think undoubtedly that people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects have many previleges . On the one hand , we can use our broad knowledge in making lots of friends and on the other hand , we can be a skillful parent and it also leads to make children talented .
(ITA,low) When a young men grows helping other people , he will do the same thing during the adulthood . It is an important thing that consent to value how a person is good or bad . In modern society is truly difficult to find a young with a non-selfish attitude . But the problem does not depends from the young , but depends by the way his parents have educaded him . This is a big problem that in the future will carry us in a much more egoistic society . If a father does n't play often with his child , if he gives only money to his boy , He does n't teach anything to his boy , and the boy will grow up without a guide . The boy will grow only with the importance of material thing , not human values . Instead if parents take care about her child 's education , and show him how to live with simple things , with real human values , and showing how they help their communities , probably the child will do the same thing in the future . So we have to give a better education to our child , with more simple and human value , not material . Only proceding in this way we will have a better society .
(HIN,high) Along with changes in generations , induviuals beliefs , thoughts , and reasoning changes . I have seen generations right from my great grand mothers age down to my little sister . For me the defination of enjoyment holds a lot of significance . Enjoyment according to me is a state in which an induviual attains `` ultimate happiness '' in what ever he or she is performing . I completely disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . To say that young people do not enjoy life comparitively is false and incorrect . If the defination of enjoyment remains stationary , then so does its impact on peoples life . The only difference arises in th eway people percieve and interpret it to be . Enjoying and relishing life to the fullest can be accomplished in several different methods . To enjoy life one doe not have to be of any particular age limit . My sister often asks my grandmother to go and enjoy her life and not sit in front of the television box the whole day and eat . But my grandmother often tells her that for her the television and food is her ultimate sense of enjoyment . For my sister to party and go out everyday with her friends is her source of entertainment and enjoyment but for someone whose old may look at it in a different way . They may say that this girl is spoilt she goes out everyday , but that is her sense of enjoyment . The difference clearly lies in the way people interpret it . But according to me my grand mother is enjoying her life as much as my sister is and she loves her life to be the way it is . By watching television it does not make her inferior , she recieves as much as joy and happiness as my sister does by going out and partying . there is no consise defination of enjoyment my grandmother is expressing the ultimate sense of happiness she sachieves by doing teh deeds above which is basically her defination of enjoyment . Yes , the generations have changed , technology and science have advanced a lot into this modern world of ours . But emotions , feeling and the ways to express it have all remained the same . It is important that the young generation begins to value and respect the emotions and the methods of expressing them from the older generations .
(GER,medium) While there are arguments to both , according to me , I believe that people , who are succesful , tend to take risks because they often develop new products and are requested by big companies . On the other hand I have to admit that also a more passive way can lead to success . Above all , statistics show that the most succesful people in business are people , who had an invention or did something that was never done before . Every year a list with the richest people on earth is introduced . Chiefly all people mentioned there created something new . Bill Gate , the inventor of the famous computer operation system windows , for instance was the first man , who created a platform , which can be used to on home computers . Now he is the richest man on earth . Furthermore , I believe that big companies looking for employees , who are able to invent creative methods in order to run the business successfully . If a person tries out different ways and takes calcular risks it shows a certain kind of inteligence . Moreover , a person , who tried a lot of different things in life has a bigger experience . For that reason big companies might prefer someone for higher positions , who may experienced certain crises in order to prevent the company doing steps , which leads to the crises . A friend of mine was working during the boom period of the it/companies , and made a lot mony during the development of the internet . Even , if his firm broke down this knowlege he had accquired during this time helped him to get another job . However , I can imagine why people might think that people although can be succesful even , if they are not risky . My father , for example , never did something else in his job : he only checked the financial bookings . He did it for almost 40 years . Day by day he did the exactly the same procedures , but during the years he became so skilled doing this that it is really improved his career . He started at the bottom and was only responsible for the booking of one particual sort of products for one district . Nevertheless , he made it to the top of a big eletronic company in Germany . Generally , I support the idea that people , who are more risky are more succesful in earning money than people , who doing what they are used to do . On the other hand , I have to admid that if you do one special jo very god you can be succesful , too .
(ITA,medium) Some people says that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , on the other hand someone says that for a student is more important to learn facts and not to understand ideas and concept . The fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , because facts can be consider a logical conseguence of the ideas and the concept , and if a student understand the ideas and the concept he can learn fact easylier and quicklier . The second says that for a student is more important to learn a fact and not to understand ideas and concept , because the history is do by the fact and not by the ideas or the concept . As far as I 'm concerned , I perfectly agree with rason of the second group of people , in fact I think that for a student is more important to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and comcepts , because in my opinion facts is the application of ideas and conception , and if a student learn facts he has more help to understand the concepts . For example if I must study the second world war for me is more important learn facts and not what ideas or what concepts there are under the facts . For example if i study the german 's invasion of poland I learn the fact , but from this fact I can understand that the Nazism 's project is to conquist all the world and this project starts from the Poland . Finally I think that a student must learn the fact because from fact he understands the ideas and the concepts that there are under the facts and not more important in the history text for example the question is about the fact and not about the ideas , this is only an example , but it is another reason for me that is more important to learn facts .
(CHI,high) Over the pass serval years , there is an common phenomenon that teachers in high schools , or even in the elementry schools try to make up the idea of teaching students concepts on some hard courses . However , do the students have the high understand of the concepts without the facts of the ideas and statements ? As far as i am concern , it is more important for strudent to learn facts than it is for them to just understand ideas and concepts due to the interest , senses , and assistance of understanding the concept . In the first place , learning facts of the statement is more interesting than for students to understand and then memorize the concepts accurately . Usually , the ideas and concepts are word-for-word stated on the text book and most students do not understand it without teacher 's explaination . This explaination is required from the teachers offering the facts , which are related tothe concepts on the text book , are easier to understand and memorize . For example , to understand the concept of The First Law of Conservation Energy - no energy is destroyed or produced in the tranformation of energy , students would choose to understand the facts that the energy has different types of energy such as potential energy and gravitational energy . Also , an interesting diagram which contains how eneryghg is being transfer would be helpful for students to unterstand the First Law of Conservation Energy . Moreover , common sense of facts for understanding a complicated concept is useful for students . Students would use what they see and think in daily life to understand everything they have difficulities with . For instance , students would understand the water property of adhesion in the example of the water strikes walking on the surface of the water . In biology , learning facts of all the living things are very important for the student to success since the biology is all based on the fact of lives . On top of that , the reason why i disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them for learn facts is because learning facts are also help students easier to understand the ideas of the study . As mentioned above , it is very helpful to learn the facts than to learn the basic concepts . In conclusion , it is more important for students for learn facts in the mordern
(TEL,medium) Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . However , i disagree with the previous statement that the younger one enjoy life more than older people . there are several reasons for holding this opinion . First , younger people are always busy with their studies and schedules because of competition among them . This hectic life might be painstaking and arduous job for younger ones when compared to the older ones as they are settled and no tensions are around them . They relax themselves playing with their kids , gardening , which soothes their mind . second , younger people need to go to their respective job for their servival . But the old people already struggled with their jobs , and earned sufficient money for their rest of life . so , they do n't need to worry about job . As someone stated that enjoying life is nothing but doing the things which soothes our mind and body . for instance , a retired police officer may not enjoy his / her younger days as he/she is busy with his / her duty as it is impossible to meet his family and friends . however , after retiring she/he can enjoy her/his remaining life . Finally , younger ones do n't have matured intelligence and the do n't know the importance of enjoying life . they think that enjoying life is nothing but having bad habits such as drinking . but , the older people enjoy life with their families and friends , which is the best . Even the younger ones do n't know how to enjoy life and the meaning of their lives . In sum up , i feel that older people enjoy their life than younger people do as they dont have much time , need to go to their jobs and they dont have matured intelligence .
(ITA,high) First of all we have to define what a successful person is . In my opinion a successful person is a person who is able to find his perfect role in the society within he lives . That is , his work and his family According to this definition , it sounds quite logical that a person has to try different roles before settle down and stop searching . Infact successful people are usually open minded and ready to try different experiences , because the convinction that who dares , wins is really strong , although you should always think about what you 're getting involved in . If a person is not satisfied of his job , he can carry it on without any satisfaction or try another one . Sure it sounds like a bet , but the choice of change can radically modify his life , and above all at the and he could say : I 've tried it . A clear example of this theory can be found in a Casino . Infact a player must always bet great amounts of money to win a lot . That 's the risk . But if the most important target of the player is to get rich , than he has no choice : he 's to bet , and if he wins he 's a successfull person because he has reached his purpose . Nowadays our society is printed with this convinction because after second world war people didnt'have anything , and so they had to bet on something to get rich . Here in Italy this convinction is really strong . The self made man is always admired and respected everywhere . For example the rapper 50 cent gave the title `` Get rich or die tryin ''' to his first record . He made a bet , investing all his money on himself and his voice . No doubt that it has been a won bet . Sure the other side of the coin is really strong , because if you fail , noone will admire you : on the contrary , you 'll be judged as a failure . But if someone wants to success , he 's to dare . The much you dare , the much you 'll success .
(SPA,medium) The the best way to travel does not has to be in a group with a specific tour guide . I have visited many countries with my family and very few of them had been with a tour guide , most of the times , we do research on the country we are going to visit and prefer to get as much information about the touristic places as we can . And we plan our own tour as a family , if we want to make a stop or stay more time in a specific place , we can do it , but we would not be able to do this if we were traveling as a group because we have already a schedule . Which we have to respect due to the rest of people we are traveling with . We have also traveled with a group , with friends of the entire family , it is a lot of fun because we share lots of great moments , but even tough , we do not travel with a tour guide , we also plan our own tour before the trip . Six years ago , we took a trip to Vail Colorado with another family , great friends of ours . In total we were 10 people , five from my family and five from their family . We went skying at the Vail mountains , even tough my parents , my brothers and I had already skyied , this was a new experience . We enjoyed it that much that I can dare to say that it has been the best trip ever , we got the opportunity to share with the other family as well as we shared with ours . We had such a great time that we made another trip together . This exciting trip made me sure that the best trips are not necessarily with a guide tour by your side .
(SPA,high) Usually , long ago people do not use the car as people use it now . Nowadays we can not live without using the car . Lot of people use the car to work , to go shopping and so forth ... There are several advantages and disadvanteges of using the car . Day by day prices of the petrol are going up and there is a luck of this energy source . Many governaments and investors are trying to develop alternative energies in order to improve the quality of cars using those energies and they are trying to promote the use of the public transport and other vehicles . On the one hand , we have those who think that in twenty years there will be more cars than now , because it is the faster and the more individual way to travel . They believe that there will be alternative sources in order to satisfy the luck of petrol , but they also argue that there will be a big demand of high technology cars . On the other hand , we have those who believe that in twenty years there will be a great decrease of cars due to people will be concerned about the enviorement and the pollution . Governaments will make the public transport cheaper and there will be many new users of this kind of transport . Maybe there will be a discover of a way of transport cheaper and faster than cars and that can be used whenever and whenever one want . On the whole , although both opinions can be argued strongly , I really believe that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than now . In fact , I think that there may be more cars than now , because the world is growing so fast and most people preffer cars than any other way of transport .
(JPN,medium) Some people say successful people try new things and take risks . It is true because when a person start to do new things he/she can keep attention from the others which helps to keep him/her high motivation , make own rules instead keep trucking somebody 's old theory , and also have more chances to be a successful person . First , when a person starts the new things usually the other people keep on eyes on him/her . It really helps to the pioneers to keep their motivation level in the high . The long term high level motivation led them to successful people . Second , if a person start new things there is no rule from the past . It indicates that the frontier can make their own rule for their work . It is really necessary fact that to start new thing because normaly the basic rules , made by somebody else , are preventing the procced thinking . Third , the risk taker can get more oppotunities to be a successful person . Risk taker can more chances than the others because if there is a risk lots of people prevent the risk and go on the easier way . Hence , under the risk there are more oppotunities and chances to be a successful person . In conclusion people who do not care about risks and willing to do new things might have more oppotunities to be a successful person . For example , our ancient Edison said new theory at his time . He seems failed at that time but actually in 21 centuries he is well known for a successful person over the world . There are lots of risks when person starts new things , but a person should not give up to go on it . Otherwise he/she cannot be a successful peson . Whoever wants to be a success try new things . It works
(ARA,high) As people climb the ladder of success their ideas tend to change from dynamic and innovative to static and conservative . I believe that succesful poeple focus and doing what they already know how to do rather than exploring or trying out new things and taking risks . Reaching a level of success whether in bussiness or in life requires time and hard work , and upon reaching success risk would be to huge of a price . For example , a bussiness man would prefer to `` keep-it-safe '' and insure his position rather than jeopardizing his whole career over a simple mistake . The same goes for trying out new things , because successful poeple are who they are due to the priciples and polices that they have followed ; and for them to abandon such polices which lead them to success would be highly unlikely . Thus the latter would prefer to follow a path of conformity instead of radical change . Another important factor that renders successful poeple to aproach new things would be their mentality ( as in how the think ) in which they tend to rely on their past experiences as a measure for thier actions , while on the other hand fresh minds tend to graps new ideas faster and better thus striving to try out new things and build new experiences . A typical example for a dynamic mind would be a fresh university graduate which is eager to learn and follow the path of success . The ladder of success changes people in many ways , as they take the first step people are willing to take risks and try out new things ; but as their journey progresses they develope a new mentality which is built on past innovative , dynamic , and fruitfull experiences thus paving the way for a more conservative and limited mentality .
(TEL,medium) I agree with the idea that now a days young people do not give enough time to help their communities . I feel this true atleast in my country . In olden days during freedom struggle many young people felt it is their resposibility to help their country to regain its glory . This can demonstrated from the fact that most of the national leaders at that time had a very good record in helping the community when they were young . May be it is because they are very enthusiastic or may be the conditions demanded them to do so but they definitely spent more time in helping community than modern day guys . Now a days young people have become more lazy mainly because the hard ship faced by the people over the period of time has reduced and that they generally do n't face the hard conditions faced by the people in earlier times . More over with the advencement of entertainment industry the young people have found a way to kill their leasure time there by not bothering about the things that are happening around them . More over with the advencement of importance of studies now a days young people often get preoccupied in their own problems finding it difficult to care about problem faced by the community . But they are not realising by neglecting the community they are neglecting them selves . The point that people are neglecting their community can be demonstrated by the point the number of strikes against bad government policies has reduced over a period of time . So i say that now a days people dont give enough time to help their communities and by doing so they are spoiling them selves and also the community . I finally say that people should spend more time for community as did by their predissors
(CHI,medium) Cars have been playing an extremely important role in the society nowadays . While people are enjoying their obvious advantages , problems come companied with the convenience they bring . More and more people are complaining about the air pollution that cars created . However , cars , as for me , will also exert an great impaction in human society in the future . And their number will not even decrease . On the contrary , the development of cars will be surprising and momentous . Twenty years can be a long time or a short time , but the development of the quality of cars , including speed , security would be tremendously huge . People will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling more places in the world that has became smaller and smaller . And there are also other aspect in their development . As you know , many institutes and countries have been doing researches to find a fuel that possess both efficiency and environmental benefits . Progress have been made in these researches . And fuels can replace the role of gasoline , whose quantity has been declining because of the explosion , have two main choices . First one , for me , is hydrogen , that can be fired and used for energy and can produce few substances that pollute the environment . The next one is the usage of solar energy , a sort of energy that can be obtained from the sunlight using peculiar ways . After about twenty years , when these two kinds of energy can be used in cars , people would like to make a use of these cars under the thought to protect environment , and this thought , will be erected in ten years ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area . Not only the improvement of the qualities of cars , but the usage of fuel leads me to believe that in twenty years , the number of cars will not decreased , but ascend in a large quantity due to both the improvement of the sence to protect public and natural environment and the usage of new fuel which will make cars the most effiencient and covenient means of transportation without polluting the environment .
(SPA,high) It would be beautiful to believe that twenty years from now fewer cars would be circulating on our streets ; but the sad truth seems to be that , in that period of time , many more vehicles will fill our streets and contribute to polluting our world . On one hand , it is true that technology is rapidly evolving and that what today is `` brand new '' , tomorrow will be completely obsolete . The perfect example of this is computers . PCs become obsolete almost as soon as they are finished . The same thing applies to cars . It could be that the great love that many have for cars today , died tomorrow due to a guilty conscience or environmental awareness . People could start using other means of transportation that pollute less . Or the automotive industry could create a new way of collective transport that would lead to less cars on the streets . On the other hand , it is difficult , in a such globalized environment , to believe that the main mean of transportation : the car , will , in such little time as twenty years , be less used . The fact of the matter is that cars are all around the world . Everybody needs one to go everywhere . Even young adults try to prove who they really are to others thanks to the car they own . In New York , for example , not everybody owns a car , but taxis are available for those who need them which is , basically , the same thing . How does someone from a small town go to work in a big city ? By car , even when there are buses or trains available . One could walk or go by bicycle to many places in his or her town : groccery store , post office , etc. , but many still prefer driving . We have to face the truth . I disagree completely with the statement because I do not believe that our world is moving in that direction . We are still not aware of the great stress cars are causing on the environment and I do not think that we will be in twenty years . It is not that I am not hopeful , I am , and I really hope that I am wrong in not believing in humans , it is just that I look out into our lives and I see what is there , not what I wish to see .
(CHI,medium) I agree with this statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . '' This why we can see so many companies invast their money in the commerical every year . First , it is fame . Maybe one company 's product is good , but if there is just few people know it . The product will fail , because it is not famous . Of course , the product will not sell well . Instead , if today this product is pretty famous , it is easier to sell . For example , I am also play the customer role in my life . I used to buy one famous brand of milk . And I quietly to buy other unfamous brand of milk . If the survey asked me `` why you always buy this brand of milk ? '' I will answer , because of it is fame , I believe the famous brand is better than others . '' However , do I really do the reserch about the milk ? And prove it real better than other brands . Of course not . Second , even the most advertisements enlarge the real funtion of product . But most people still believe that , and they will try to buy it . Because they want make their life better . For instance , the energy drink , there are many people drink this kind of beverage . They believe this drink brings them energy and power . Somehow , some people even think they cannot live without it . Is it really have so wonderful effect on the body ? I do n't agree with it . I think the purchasing is result from the advertisement . It makes people believed what they saw . To sum up , I strongly agree with this satement . Because I am also the customer in my life . Through the advertisements , they meke me to trust their funtion better than they really are in the life .
(ITA,medium) I definitely disagree with the statement because , if we look at the present growth rate of cars in use , I think we could realize that we will face a substantial increase in number in the future and therefore also in twenty years the number will be higher than today . It is possible to explain my position with my following considerations . Developed Countries like the United States , the majority of European Countries together with Japan are experiencing constant demand of cars since more and more people are becoming independent and therefore need a car for going to work , for their spare time spent in travelling , reaching other people to different places . If we also think that Developing Countries like India , China and maybe some Eastern European Countries and some South American Countries are facing an important positive change in their growing economy , we can infer that a lot of more people will feel the necessity of a car for everyday trips . Moreover we can consider that cars have become a symbol other than a mean of transportation in the last years , especially for some wealthy societies . This situation can be seen at the same way for the Developing Countries in a few decades , therefore this can be a sign to support my disagree with the statement . My thought is also supported by a holiday trip I made in April this year , when I went to California in the United States . When I was there I realized that more than in Italy people need a car , because of the long distances and because of the fact that they live independently from their family . Since the United States have a very advanced economy and the other Countries are going into that direction , I presume that even the Developing Countries will face that economic evolution step . In conclusion I think that the number of cars will increase in the future due to the fact that can be related as a consequence and a step of the growing process of the economy of a Country .
(FRE,high) Some people say that in order to be successful you must `` try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you already know how to do well '' . Personnally , I do not agree with this statement . I am going to give you two reasons why you should do only what you already know so as to be successful . First let 's define ` success ' . In my opinion , the ` successful ' characteristic should be given to someone who is good at what he 's doing and even better than others . In this context , we must admit that the only reason for success is training . In fact , training leads to success . But what exactly is training ? Actually training is all about doing what you already know over and over again . Let 's take the example of sports . In every sport , you spend the main part of your time training in order to be successful at the next competition . Therefore , this is exactly the same idea in everyday 's life business . Another example is the success of Fordism , back in its time . Here , people were meant to perform the same task over and over again which lead to an improvement in industry . Firms which used Fordism are now known to have been successful . Another idea of the statement is that if you want to be successful , you must take risks . Actually , this is completely wrong and the reason is simple : if you take no risk , you are less subject to failures . And knowing that failures are the exact opposite of success , you should take this advice : if you want to succeed , never take risks . Instead , you can let others taking risks and watch their results . This way , you will see if it is a safe and efficient way to do the thing . Finally , success can be achieved using two motos : `` Only do what you already know '' and `` Never take any risk '' . Look at how sport champions prepare their competitions : they train a lot whithout taking any risk . Then you will succeed like a real champion .
(GER,medium) I agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take risks earlier than other people . In my opinion successful people know what to do for a well doing business . They are more confindet because of there success . I think only the developing of new ways and new technologies can make you successfull for a long time and that is what the they want to have . Success for the rest of their live . They know that when they stay at there level , maybe the others will enforce them and then they fall down at a lower level . So the invention of new things is also a defense mechanism . I think , if you are successful and you do the same work everyday than you get borred on what you are doing . For good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is borring you even can not enjoy it . Another reason for taking risks is that the people maybee will not loose there jobs when they are unsuccessful . That gives them the possibility to improve new procedures . Propably the fact of beeing restless and of taking risks is the key for beeing successful . And when you are succesful it is easier to try new things . Think about a person how sells newspapers the hole day , if he try new things for selling more newspapers , it can have a bad end for him . If his plan failed than he might loose his job and even that is the reason for him to not take the risk . All in all , i think the main reason for trying new things is that the person who take the risk is much more self-convident like the others and self-convidence makes winners .
(ITA,low) I think that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . My opinion is supported by our everydays ' life where the people has many suddenly problems at scholl or in work . If I have a good knowledge in a specific subject I can well do a specific work , but it is impossible to have a work where there are n't problem with other specific work . So this is important that the university or in general the school give a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and support in general the culture . Because if our society is composed by person who do not want understand to much of things but want understand determinated or specifically things , this society is died . My university is the best exaples to demonstrate that it is important studies many subjects than studies a specific subjects
(SPA,medium) Trowgh the history of knowledge , there have been many ideas and trends about the best way to get and approach it . May be the most common ones that are still present in our academic lives , and command most of the present teaching models we can find at schools and university . The firs of them and may be the older one , inducts the knowledge , that mens some one have that knowledge and give it to others , that person is the master , the autority and almost superior , and their alumns follow him . In to the other hand , we can find a more modern concept that promote the constructions of knowledge , that means each person can approach the knowledge in their own way , can get the ideas and concepts and constructs whith them . In that case there are facilitators who gives that concept and the tools that students need . That we can usually find this days in schools and even at university is a combination of both so depending on what is strongly enphasised we will get different result . Personally , I studied in a Waldorf school that emphasis the construction approach to knowledge and later I had to go into a traditional school , that emphasis in induction of knowledge . Now I am sure I had an advantage over the other students in the traditional school because I primarly lern how to get and understand ideas and concepts and construct knowledge . If you just learn fact , with time you shurely forget them . If you clearly understand concepst you will be able to construct again knowledge .
(SPA,high) In twenty years there will be much more cars in use than there are today , if nothing unusual like a world war happens . And the main reason to support this idea is just because the world 's population is growing very fast . In particular , the population of developing countries is increasing at a rapid rate , and many of these countries are attaining very high rates of development . Let us think about China : it has a population of more than one billion people . China 's economic growth rate is 9 % . Nowadays still many people in China is poor , but as long as the country continues to recover , more and more cars will be demanded . The same phenomum is occuring in countries like Brasil or India . The fact that the amount of oil to produce petrol is limited and will no longer exist as the main powering source used by cars and other means of transport , does not imply that the amount of existing cars will be reduced in twenty years . First , after that period , there still will be petrol enough to be used by cars , and second , there will be other alternative sources of energy like hydrogen . Like or not , cars are nowadays our principal mean of transport , even people do not use them in an efficient way . Many people go to their job by car , and prefer it to the public transport . But , for example , most of the times an average person uses a big car of four places for this purpouse . This causes many traffic problems and pollution . To solve this new public policies are necessary to reinforce and to enhance the use of public transport by making it cheaper . In conclusion in twenty years will be definetively more cars than today but they should be re-invented . They probably will be different : smaller ( just for one person or two ) , they will consume less energy and use alternative-clean energy sources ... This issue is related with our great goal as humans , which is to care about sustainable development
(ITA,medium) Advertisments are driving the market . In nowadays world , the best companies are esily recongnisible from their advertisments . All the great companies have a fantastic advertisment campaign in order to promote their product/s . On this direction , all the new emergents business are working on creating fantastic advertisments to break into the market and obtaining a huge amount of counsumers ready to consume teir product/service . The only problem is that these new companies are focusing so much on the advertisement that they stop to take care of the quality of the product . For these reasons we have on the market there well made advertisments promoting a product that is not so good . It is true that the most important point of an advertisment is to give to the customer a sensation of a dream . Companies want to convince customers that their product/service is the best on the market , but consumers , if are not satisfied in the product that they bought , they will never buy that product again . From a sourvey that I road in the Economist , I discovered that the dissatisfaction in customers has incresed of 40 % these last twenty years . The responsable is probably this new trend of exagiring the product/service quality to much by advertisments . For example , I remembered when I bought a pair of tennis shoes from a new sport cloathing company called ttk . I have been attracted to this pair of shoes from the desines enphasize on a billboard with a slogan on the buttom that was saying `` ttk ... the shoes of the warriors ... '' . There was also written under the slogan that they were one of the most resisten shoes on the market . After that I bought these shoes , I succed to play tennis just ten times : they were already completely destroyed ! I believe that if companies will not change the way of advertising , consumers will not trust them anymore , and also the big corprations will have a decrease in the sales .
(TUR,high) Learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts are actually the most significant elements for students but i agree with the given statement and think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . I think there are some reasons make students behave this way . First of all , we are all in a very competitive school environment and we have to get high grades at school . In order to get high grades we have to study very hard . But while we are studing we see that the ideas and concepts are more in important in the exams than the facts . I maen the teachers ask us about the specific methods , ideas or the concepts rather than the truths or facts . Therefore in order to be successful we deal with the important points of the exams and it is certain that ideas and concepts are more important in the exams . I can say that i do the same thing and i deal with the concepts and ideas more than i care about to learn facts . Secondly i can frankly indicate that today students are lazy . Learning the facts need more skills like critical thinking , assessing the issues and clarifying the different aspects of them and etc. but on the other hand understanding the methods , idaes or concepts is something more easier . To be able to understand the ideas or concepts you do not have to think of it detailly , you can only study the course materials and maybe memorize them . Thus i can suggest that understanding the ideas is more easier for students than learning the facts . That is why they find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Another element make students feel this way is the education system . I can give examples from my country . In Turkey the education system leads students to feel and behave this way . For instance in our history courses they just make us to memorize the ideas and the concepts instead of giving us information and background about the facts . We memorize the dates of the wars or important events during the reign of a sultan but unfortunately we can not deal with the realities . Hence i can indicate that education system is a very basic and significant element at this issue . All in all , it is cartain that students find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts but i hope one day it will change and we will start thinking of the facts more than we do today . I think this will be a very significant milestone in students education life and more creative and good skilled young students will be trained .
(FRE,high) The widely spread belief that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is for me not only totally wrong , but in complete opposition with what the concept `` to travel '' is intended to be . First of all , the transportation mean - a bus - is simply not adequate for the activity . I would assume that if a person travels , this person would like to smell and taste to country to be discovered , would aspire to new connections and interactions . How can you ever be able to accomplish those aims through the windows of a big tourist bus ? The best way to discover a new city is to walk down its roads , to loose yourself in it . Secondly , traveling in a group means that while you visit new places , while you cross unkown environments , mom and dad and maybe your best friend is comfortably seated on your right side . You feel at home , you engage conversations with the people you live with every other day . Akward position when the true beauty of traveling around is to meet new people , to ask about their way of seeing things or how they manage their ruts . Being surrounded by a well organised group does not facilitate the aperture towards the other traveling should be all about . In third position comes the tour guide issue . Those guides are often paid by their governments to bring the tourists to specific sites , monuments or landscapes where the infrastructures have been built to receive them . Economical benefits are therefore in the air , many tourist guides will not hesitate to equivocate supposedly rich people to fill their pockets . Finally , the overbooked agenda the touring agency plans for you often ends up being more exhausting than the actual work tourists are running away from on vacations . To travel should mean to live without a watch , to follow the wave , to let the unexpected surprise you . I would rather avoid any time planing , thus leaving space to improvisation and first impulses . Two precious elements that will never cross the path of a touring group ... Traveling in a group led by a tour guide completly disconnects you from reality . One should know the difference between being a tourist and being a traveller . I believe the second to be so much worth than the first . If only people could think that way , they would find a little treasure .
(KOR,high) Young people and older people have same qualities of life . The only difference between the two groups of people are that young people are more active whereas older people are less mobile . However , there is no limit to enjoying life . Therefore , I believe that young people and elderly enjoy life similarly . Young people have more passion , dreams , and ambitions . They enjoy life by their own ways . For example , young enjoy life by going for drives , clubs , bars , or many different kinds of activities available . They may enjoy life more enthusiastically and with more thrill , however , elderly also get the same joy out of simpler things . There are numerous available activities for elders . The city supports elders by building senior homes and providing other servieces such as bingo . Older people get together often to drink tea , talk about books that they have read , share recepies , or talk in general . All people are unique and thus they enjoy different activities . Some might like to play basketball , some might like reading , some might like to listen to music . Therefore , enjoying their favourite activity differs . For example , an older person reading a book in a chair can feel the same joy as a young man playing basketball . Thus , there are no such thing as enjoying life more than others . Although there are more variety of activities for a young person to enjoy his life , the same can be done by an older person . Nowadays , with the medical advances , humans ' life span has increased considerably . The population of the elderly is increasing . Following this increase , there are increase in activities which are only meant for older people . For example , my grandmother recently found a facility which is only for seniors . Now she goes there regularly to swim , talk with her friends and to participate in choir . As explained above , one can enjoy one 's life according to one 's own likes and dislikes . It depends on their personality , not on the age . There are many ways to enjoy life as a young person or as an older person . One should find those ways and enjoy life to the fullest .
(HIN,high) The question is very tricky as people across all walks of life and across all age groups like to enjoy and it is rather tough to quantify and compare their levels of enjoyment . Besides there could be people who could derive a tremnendous sense of enjoyment by the most trivial of acts such as the sight of smiling infant . While there could be some who are never happy with the state of affairs in their lives despite having the best comforts in the world . In comparing youngsters and adults on the mentioned statement , I personally feel that as youngsters we try to live life to the fullest . Though we realise the importance of making a career for ourselves we also make it a point to have a ball as and when time permits . Older people generally tend to be more spiritually inclined and prefer to spend their time doing community work that brings them a sense of satisifaction more than the thrill of enjoyment . Besides there might also be the feeling that they are beyong the ` age ' to enjoy life in a way as extravagent as we youngters can . Also the fact that compounds this belief is that as today 's youngsters we have more modes and sources of entertainment and enjoyment at our disposal than did the elders when they were in their prime . Take for example Computers and Televsion , two of the commonest modes of entertainment today that were not even invented when our grandads and grand nannies were our age . This sheer availability of resources to us affects our ability to enjoy more . Then again it is more a matter of personal choice or opinion as every person has his own definition of enjoymnent . As per the way I percieve it I believe that yongsters today enjoy life on a larger scale that older people do .
(TEL,high) `` I know not how the third world war is going to be , but I know that fourth world war is going to be with stones and sticks '' , this is a famous quote by Sir Albert Einstein . TODAY is world of rapid technological and industrial advancement , the day is not far when there is a saturation of sources eventually leading to retrogradation of the society . I would absolutely agree that in the next twenty years ther would be fewer cars than they were today . I remember reading the poems of William Wordsworth , beautifully describing the countryside and mother nature . In today 's world it is indeed impossible to find such a place in real . Right from the inception man is driven by a quest for knowledge . There is an urge or a curiosity to know and to find out things around him . This has definitely led to the industrial revolution . One of the biggest achievements has been the invention of the automobiles . With the development of cars and other means of trasnport the world had definitely become a smaller place . conveyeance was made easier and effective . But one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it has created . I would like to state an example , I live in a big city and it takes me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometers away from my house . I will have plan out things before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far as it literally takes me years to reach my destination . There has been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobiles . This pollution not only effects the environment but also to living beings . The number of cases of asthma and other lung diseases have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicles . There are cases of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead components released by the vehicles . In earlier days , cars were a status issue . People who were wealthy only could afford a car . It is no longer so . Although people are able to buy cars but the maintainance of cars is a difficult task in todays 's wrold . It is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it . Today there is an increasing urge to GO GREEN by reducing the individual contribution to go green . People are reverting to the use of cycles and bikes which use plants as fuel . People are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destinations . Hence I would like to conclude that although there is a continuous rise in the number of cars , after a span of twenty years the number of cars will reduce due to increasing awareness among people .
(ARA,high) Although travelling in a group led by a tour guide could have a great positive impact on the travellers experience and knowledge base , such perks are more that often diminished in comparison to the manifold problems and distractions that arise from such trips . It is true that tour guides , especially local ones , are more knowledgeable when it comes to their cities and provide deeper insights and plausible suggestions on what and where to see and do . Futhermore , in a group situation , being part of events and trips is usually more interesting and enjoyable and provides a great opportunity to meet other people and make new friends . However having a tour guide and being part of a group could hinder the overall experience of a city or place due to the numerous formalities and regulations they tend to emphasize . With tour guides comes cast in concrete planning of every minute and hour of every day , week and month . Since tour guides are managing large groups of people it is very important to keep time and schedule for every aspect of the trip ; from visiting monuments and tourist sites to dining and sleeping . Unfortunately , this would take away all the spontaneaity from the trip rendering it very systematic , dry and simply boring . Not knowing what you are going to do for the day , or sleeping in in another might be all that you need to rejuvenate yourself during your travels . Paralleling such arguments and in response to the dynamics of group travelling , many other negative aspects usually arise . Having too many people would usually result in conflict ; it is very hard to get consensus in the case of a decision making situation . Furthermore , it is the nature of a group to include people from diverse backgrounds and value systems . This would more than often surface at some point and cause some kind of disagreement that would result in a bigger complication that both parties would have to keep up with until the end of the trip . Therefore , one can avoid such problems when travelling by choosing to travel with a couple of friends or family members instead of being part of large highly organized systematic group experirnce . Having a guide book or asking locals for suggestions would adequately substiture for a nagging tour guide . Now a person could be more spontaneas and not governed by rules and regulations on the only true break he/she might get per year . I believe I have strong convictions towards my opinions for the reason that I was part of a group trip that was led by a tour guide for too long period of time during one of my summer vacations and that certainly did not turn out to be a good experience .
(ARA,low) Many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree with them beacause of the fllowoing reasons . may be because they love the playing more than the work and that is real . Other reason I think because they are less intelligent than the old people so they do not know enough about the correct things . First , young people like the playing so much . I think all the people like the playing so much but not as the young people . Also I think that most of the young people have a school so they have to study more than the adults . So their free time will be very little and if they spend it at working I think they will get tired . In addation , their bodies are weaker than the adults so they can not do the same job just like the adults . Next , I think the young people do not think about their communities because it is over their thinking . They have a limited brain . Also they have a lot of fun which can make them busy . To sum it up , I think that the young people can not service the community as the adults . Because of they like the playing so much . Also they have a lot of fun and homeworks which can make them busy to work like the adults .
(TEL,high) I beleive that , it is only people who will to take risk would become sucessful . Once a person is sucessful he would always want to increse his popularity by trying out new things . He would never want his business or company to be stagnant . In todays competitive world , people are paid for their creativity and creativity is nothing but trying or finding new ways and things . First of all let us consider the field of acting . A moviestar would become sucessful because of a particular kind of role . For example Shah Rukh Khan , became popular for the role of a lover . But he doesnt portray the same role in all his movies . He has acted as a villian , an action hereo etc , and still he is the number one hero in India . His sucess in the role of a lover boy did not constrain him from trying other roles . Infact he is one of the most versatile actors in India . Let us take up industries as another example . A company would become sucessful for a particular produt say a chocolate . The people of the company would not stop at this point by selling only their popular product . Instead they would try to venture other areas like ice creams or even soap or shampoo . Carrying out the same technique may always not lead to sucess as many other people could have copied the same technique . Well it is always safe to carry out things the way one already knows and there may be no fear of loss or failurewhile taking a new way may end up in a problem . I feel it is better to take risks and enjoy the sucess it brings . Thus taking risk and trying out new ways has its own advantages and disadvantages , one needs to be daring enough to take the risk .
(FRE,high) Some people might believe that teenagers are not giving enough time to helping their communities . This phenomenon can vaguely be related to the advent of individualism . People are more and more self-centered , and tend to forgive the values of our society an how to share with others . I disagree with that . In this brief essay , I will give a few examples about people who dedicates themselves to communities . We have been witnessing lots of changes during the last century . Forests have been devastated , wild animals are threatened of extinction . When I was a teenager , I created with some of my friends an association whose main goal was to protect a particular specy of owl . We organized meeting with neighbors to inform them about that owl : how it lives , how it reproduces , and how it survived . Then we asked about local scientists to embrace our cause and give more weigh to our communication . We wrote articles too . I left that club when my parents had to move away because of their job responsibilities . But I kept in touch with my friends and our association still exists . Another example is about the increasing amount of garbage that humans are producing each year . I saw on Television last week that people in france are creating associations in order to clean areas that have been polluted over the past decades . These associations are surprisingly mainly managed by young people , who find sponsors , gather funds , and coordinate their activities . Finally , one of my colleague created a project useful for minorities , such as blind or deaf people . With the help of our mayor , he planned to build infrastructures to help people cross the street , go into an elevator . As I see more and more people around me giving their time for such causes , I 'm really convinced about the implication o
(CHI,medium) Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people , because then think young people may have more energy , however , in my opinion , both of them enjoy life very much but in different aspects . First , to young people , they consider life to be exciting and full of enthusiasm . Therefore , the prefer to express their enjoying behavior external , like playing some stimulating sports , go hiking to some dangerous places with thir cooperates and friends . Futhurmore , they may eat spicy food , wear strange coats whatever they want , it is a approach that young people enjoy their life . On the other hand , because of their young , they have to vork for their rest of life , which means they should accumulate their properties , do work assiduous in order to have a comfort life when they are old . Then , to old people , they have worked for most of their life , and when they became old , they have the oppotunitis to spend leisure time on enjoying . Moreover they already possess adequate money for themselves to enjoy their rest of life . Also , the olds know actually about what they want and where they want to go , and their sufficient life experience make them full of intellingece , they could obeserve life insightly , the way the enjoy , for instance , is only a cup of tea , or look the scenery out of the window . Bigger inspiration they want perhaps to travel around earth , to see some things then had never seen , to go to some places they had never went to . Old people can even enjoy the life more in contrast to the young people , they are the people who are no longer interfered by earning money and strain life work . From my point of view , in summary , we can not say who enjoy more , because all the people acquint themselves with theway of enjoying life , and know the crucial meaning of enjoying life and releasing themselves , though they do it via different way and holding different emotion .
(ITA,medium) I strongly agree with the statement that says that young people Nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities because our modern society is very corrupted , and one of these negative aspects is certainly social selfishness . Whit this word I want to say that in our modern society every person tends to think only at his own life whitout spending time for the community or thinking to the other people . This sense of selfishness was absent from society only a few decades ago , but whit the past of the time it is became a very common aspect of human behavior . whit the past of the time in fact people have became more isoleted and worried about their own lifes that they have forgotten that around them there is a society , and that to mantein a general political and social balance every person has to solve a particular role in this society . wit the past of the time in fact every person has tried to overcome the others to became a self made man satisfied of his or her leader behavior . The most negative aspect is not that this idea is very spread in the society in wich we live , but the way in which this teory is speading : every family in fact tend to teach to their sons that the most important thing in a person 's life is become someone important and reach . I belive that this negative teaching have corrupted our society and there is no possibility to return back ; we live in a world damaged and characterized by values completly different from the real values of the past , in whic friendship and sense of helping the community were the key ideas . In conclusion I would like to underline that it is true that in our society is not present the sense of community helping by the young people , but at the same time it is not correct to accuse young people to be the initiators of this fact because it is only a conseqence of a proces started many decades ago . I seriously belief that if we do not begin to rebalance the values of our society we will live in a very corrupted world in which the most difficult thing it will be simly to live in !
(CHI,high) In 20 Years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today With the constant advancement of technology in our world today , many solutions to problems we face today can be solved . Certain issues that can be seen to have always been discussed and debated over , time after time can probably come to an end . Through advancements of technology and the convenience that cars seem to have brought to human beings , it came hand in hand with a number of issues that are widely discussed today . First of all , there is the pollution issue that rises or declines with the usage of cars . Next , there is the depletion of scarce resources that we use to fuel our cars . Last but not least , is the cost of purchasing a car and the gas to fuel it . It is because of these issues , that there is a high chance that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Pollution contributes to the usage rate of cars within a country . Take Bangkok , a city that is polluted and notorious for its traffic jams as an example . People living in Bangkok are probably immune to the amount of pollution that they breathe and interact with everyday . Tourists however , are a different story in terms of the pollution rate in Thailand . Some complain of bad skin , some claim of constant coughs , some complain on blurred vision with the amount of smoke on the streets . When the pollution rate of a city is so high , there will be a reduction in the amount of cars that are used . The government will most probably bring out policies that control the amount of cars through means of indirect tax on cars and the amount of roads that they allow to pass through at a given time period . In this case , it would just be convenient for people to travel through modes of public transportation . When there are tax on cars , lesser people will purchase cars , and for convenience purposes , more will use public transportation . Thereby , reducing the amount of cars that are being bought and driven on a daily basis . Following that would be the depletion of scarce resources of gas . The escalating oil prices have made headlines more than once in any form of mass media worldwide . The Thai government had subsidized the oil price from rising in Thailand for quite a while , and this allow the Thais to continue their transportation as they wish . However , after the Thai government ceased to subsidize the oil price , did public modes of transportation like the subway become overcrowded . With the gradual depletion of scarce resources like that of oil that fuels the car in which we drive in , the costs for the scarce resource will rise . When a price of a good rises , this will discourage the consumers from purchasing such a product . It can be seen that oil fuels cars , so without fuel for cars , there will be adequate reason to purchase or use more cars . In this case , the amount of cars that are used today and in twenty years time will most likely have decreased substantially . Last but not least is the better alternatives that our technology is coming up with . On a day-to-day basis , there are advancements of technology seen everywhere . Even after the rising gas costs , countries turned to alternatives of gas . In a few years of course , it can most probably be assumed that gas will run out so another alternative will have to be thought of . Now with the convenience of public transportation in the sense that it is more efficient , less time consuming and cheaper in terms of gas and maintainence price of the car . Most people will be turning to public modes of transportation as opposed to private modes of transportation in travelling in cars . More and more people are becoming educated , and this has increased in the awareness of the environment . People will then try to reduce the amount of pollution by using less of products that produce pollution by finding other alternatives like that of using public modes of transportation . In this case , because cars produce a significant amount of pollution to our world , the amount of car purchases will have decreased quite a deal . Hence , it can probably be seen and assumed that within 20 years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . With escalating oil costs and pollution , gradual depletion of scarce resources , better technology that can come up with alternatives and enivornmental friendly people , the amount of cars that will be purchased in the next few years will be gradually declining . Therefore , it can be assumed that in 20 years time , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
(ARA,high) i do agree with this statement . people who take the risks are the ones who are successful . for exmaple , if we look into our everyday lives , we can see that most millionares and billionares are the people who have actually tried something in thier lives and the people with normal wages are the people who are working for them . The difference between the Employer and the Employee . Not all these successful people begin successful or even have a gift that they are born with ... in some cases that is . Most of those people are born just like you and me , and just have vague ideas of particular suff excatly like everyone else . The only problem is that they have the courage to actually take a shot and see if thier idea works unlike everyone else who walks around saying that i had an idea or i though of that ! If no one actually took the shot of doing something and showing the whole wide world what he was thinking about most inventions in our time now would not have existed and we would be where our ancestors were before thousands ands thousands of yeas ago , right back to the times of cavemen using tools made out of wood and rocks . so imagine this , no cell phones , no tv 's , no cars , no washing machines , no driers , no ovens no nothing ! yes you probably envy those `` successful '' people and wish that was you or you just pray to god that he would lose all his money in a way and eventually become a `` normal '' paid citizen just like you are but as a matter of fact if it wasnt for his risk on showing his idea your necessaties or goods that you buy for liesure would not have been provided for you . We are all basically the same , but these special people who come up everytime and time again are the successful people . Now i know for a fact that i might not be one of them but you can always hope for things to happen for you . Try your best at taking risks as you never know you might end up on the `` successful '' list . Theres no use of living your whole life without taking a risk ... whats the fun of life then .
(FRE,low) Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . In first I think who it ' s very important to take risks or try new things because the innovation it is the best quallity for pass in the life . For example if I open a restaurant i would like who he is different of others restaurants . it is very important who are difference between my restaurant and the others . The most quality of one cretors it is a innovation . In second it ' s true who take risks and try new things it 's not a good idea because it is very dangerous . If I open a restaurant with a new concept it 's not mentionned that I will have a good results at the begining . It is a risk : we take it or we not take it . I understand that people try new things and take risks but I think who it is very dangerous but we must try or take risks for pass in the life .
(FRE,medium) It 's easier to learn facts than understand the ideas and concepts which generate them . While some students may think it 's more important to understand ideas ; others prefer focusing only on facts . In my opinion , it 's worth it to try to deal with ideas and concepts . Ideas and concepts allow us to understand the reasons of what happen in our world . Facts are only a result of something and never provide enough information . When a student focus on ideas and concepts , he will understand much easier new events . In my opinion , focusing on facts is too restrictive and does n't provide any new abilities . When i was litlle , my physic teacher was always explaining us the reason why something happen . It was hard in the beginning but i developed the will to work in a research department . The last but not least , it 's just more interesting to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . When we learn facts we probably do n't understand the meaning of the event . Students who are lazy will choose to learn facts without understanding the concept around . I have always thought it is pretty borring to try to remember by heart something because i just do n't understand . I did it when i was in history class . I tried to remember everything and just gave it to my teacher during the exam . When i begin to understand ideas and concepts behind those facts , i was able to learn more information . In conclusion , it seems obvious that it 's more worth it for students to deal with ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts . The opportunity to provide more abilities in understanding others subjects and the interest to be able to learn more are two main reasons .
(KOR,high) It is often said that one should be good at a special field . However , I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . The main reasons are that modern society require students to a lot of special skills and many specific subjects are beneficial for students to get a job . To begin with , today 's society demand students for a wider variety of skills such as economics , langages , sports . Although student had to give up so many things llke as he spend time playing with friends , studying many academic subjects compensate for his future life . For example , these days are more and more globalized , many students are able to speak a couple of foreign langages such as English , Chiness , Japanese . In addition , a student with many special research areas tend to easily get job that he want to work . For instnace , last year , my cousin entered the Samsung , which is one of the world famous companies because he had majored several subjects while University . HIs research fields are economics , eletronic engeneerings which impresses on interview In conclusion , I strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects are better than speciallizing in one specific sugject becaus current society require students many skills and most firms consider into student 's various subjects .
(TUR,high) While reading the succesful people 's lifes you should probably see that they are the ones who try new things , take risks and try to create and use something different than they usually do . Successful people , try to create something different , use oppurtunities to do something new in their fields and take risks . First of all being successful needs the ability of trying new things other than the usual . Trying new things and creating some ideas make the person to move upwards in his or her career . For example creators of the '' Youtube '' did something that has not done before . They find an idea , improve it and create the one of the most successful internet sites which cause revolution in this field . So being open to new things and able to show the ability to implement this idea makes a person successful . An other ability needed for being successful is , using the oppurtunities and not to be afraid of doing something unusual . People often stick with things that are good at , but trying new tehniques and using the oppurtunities to do something new and different , brings the success . The last thing I like to mention about what brings success is , taking risks . Other than doing the standart things and taking risks can be very beneficial to someone . For example , showing the courage to invest in a field that no one has ever invested before may turn out very well . The risk taker may earn a fortune simply just using the opportunity by taking risk . In summary , people who are open to try new things , creating something different than the others by using opportunities and take risks are allways become successful at the end . No matter how hard they try , people who have these qualities will garantee the success .
(TEL,medium) I donot agree that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communties . Youth are very enthustiastic about helping other people . I can prove my point with real life examples of me and friends are giving our best effort to improve our communities in all sort of ways . It is a big misconception that youth is inactive in community service today . First , I have a friend called Ravi . He is a very busy and diligent student . He very normal and contemporary . But , he never allows these reasons to overshadow he ability to perform community service . He went a eye hospital `` AMG '' in Rajavolu in Rajahmundry . This is free hospital for the health needs of the poor and needy . He wanted to give his best effort to support the cause of the hospital eventhough he is very busy . During holidays for the 9th summer , He became involved in eye screening of the poor school children . After receving the guidance of a establisted opthamologist he went to screen the children for vitamin A deficiency . He made a check list of each symptomes for individual child and reported it to the doctor for more medical care . Next summer he became involved in Glacoma awareness camp . In this camp he counselled patients and explained the importance of medication for the serious disease such as Glacoma . These were few for his many accomplishments . He told his friends including me the joy in giving a `` hand of help '' for our community . His expriences had a huge influence on us . We too became involved in various voluntary services . I became involved in adult education campaign . Here I taught some illiterate adults basic reading and writing skills . This experience had huge influence on me . I could access how valuble education is when I saw the plight of the illiterate adults . I will never forget this experience . Finally , All these experiences show that youth definetly involves in community service . Youth need encouragement and good support from thier family and friends to make this possible . Youth will realise that community service give a kind of self satisfaction that very valuble . In conclusion , young people realise that this society is ours and we have responsibility to serve for our societies .
(KOR,high) `` We should try everything as possible as many things before he become old . '' My parents used to tell me since i was young . It means that we can not do everything , which we want to do , when we become old , becasue old people can not have the power of life , eventhough they have exprienced knowledge and money . I aagree with the following statement . '' Young people enjoy life more than older peole do . '' Firstly , when we are young , we have the important things for living our life , such as power of life and youngness . Therefore , the two things can help us challeng and try everything in our life . In the news , sometimes we could hear about news that young people challenge something incredible or accomplish something . Few monthes age , i heard a news about handcapped group of peole challege to swim . And they finally accomplished their goal , such as making short time records . I believed that if we do not have the power of our life and youngness , we can out challenge and try to do everything . Secondly , if we are young , we do not know abour fear . if could make us enjoying life more than older people . Usually , older people know fear of life well , becaseu they have much more expereices and hear about more happendings many times . Thus older people know more fear about everything . But , for young peole they are inexperienced about everything our life . Thus young peole do not have much fear than older people . We could see many examples world widely well , young people loves to try very wild and dangerous sports , such as sky diving and snow bording . When i went ski and snow bording place , i could see the 95 percent of snow border was youg people , who want to feel the danger and speed . Young people loves to feel fear and always want to challenge wildness in the world . Lastly , eventhough older people usually have money , they can not evjoy their life than young people , becasue they think their future too much . Older people think about their future , death , family and other suff alot , becasue they know their responsibilities . But usually , for young people they do not think about theur future , job , family or other suff , becasue bascailly they have much time than older peole . Young people could do their stuffs in their future , but for older people , they do nopt have much time , so they have to spend their time more valuably . It always makes stoping older people enjoy their life . For my personal example , just next my house , there is one family . The family has old parents and two youg childrens . Since last year , they all wanted to go travel every places in the world , the all family tried to go travel , but only their two children could go travel , becasue when they were living travel , parenst were start thinking anout their time , money , future , and everythings . But their childrens did not thinkg about their suddroundings , and just decided to go travel , finally only their chidrlen could go travel . Older peole can not enjoy their life , becasue they care about their surroudning problems too much , espeicially time . In other words , young people enjoy life more than older people do , becasue young people have the power of life and youngness , these two things make them challenging . Young people are unexperienced people , so they do not know the fear of life . Thus sometimes , they could be very brave . Lastly , everhtough older peole usually have much more money , h \ they can not enjoy life , becasue they care about their surrounging problems , such as time .
(SPA,high) Things in life are usually not black or white . It is difficult to say if it 's better to work on having a broad knowledge on many different academic subjects or to put that same amount of effort on specializing on an specific field . In my opinion it all depends on the short term objectives of the student which is , after all , closely related to the age . For young age students who are in school , high-school or even in the first years of university , studying a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects will probably be more suitable . Diversity is basic in these stages for various reasons . First of all , students need to obtain certain level of general culture , what includes history , geography , maths , literature , grammar , sciences ... It also needs to be taken into account that some subjects interact with each other . Someone ca n't study physics with no math knowledge , so a variety of fields need to be covered . Finally , it is also important for young students to become familiar with a variety of fields so that they can choose what they would like to specialize on in the future : it would n't be sensible to let a ten year old chose if he wants to study only biology f just because he likes that particular subject at that stage , for example . They need to have a global vision before deciding what the like , and the way of obtaining it is simply studying a broad syllabus . However when considering adult students , priorities obviously change . For people in their late university years or in graduate courses specializing in a particular subject is basic . The most important reason is that companies require specialists to cover job positions . Companies are not usually interested in people who only know a little bit about lots of subjects . They look for indivuduals who are proficient and have a deep knowledge and understanding of specific fields and industries . If the candidate additionally has a broad knoowledge of other things it can then be considered as a plus , but the first characteristic is that he/she is a specialist in a particular subject . As a conclusion it could be said that the age of the student is the best indicator to determine whether it is more suitable to study a broad selection of subjects or to focus all the effort in an specific field .
(CHI,high) I agree that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide even though some people might prefer travelling on their own . First , people can make new friends in the tourist group . When one person travels alone or with his or her family members only , it is quite possible that he or she willl get bored . If people travel in a group , they can meet different people and make new friends with the group members during the trip . Generally , tourists will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provides adequate time for people to get to know each other and make new friends . Second , to travel in a group would bring more fun . When people travel alone , they might feel it is a pity that nobody shares this experince with them . While in a group , people can share this wonderful experience with the group members . The lasting memory of travelling would be enriched by the happiness added by the group members . Third , it would be efficient and organized when the tourist group is led by a guide . The guide would arrange the travel in the best way , which means travellers need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travelling . Travellers do not need to find information themselves and they do not need to worry about where to sleep at night , how to find the direction or how to take the transportation . In addition , the tourist guide can provide adquate information for the history and uniqueness of the scenic spots . The tourists only need to listen to the guide and enjoy themselves . Because people can make new friends , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , I support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
(SPA,high) Nowadays , cars are one of the most important features of our living style . They make our existence easier by letting us move from one place to another faster than walking . They also let us travel to places far from where we live which otherwise would be impossible to reach . However , cars have disadvantages such as the difficulties to find somewhere to park the car , the amount of money we spend on fuel and the pollution they live behind . In my opinion , in twenty years there will be more or , at least , as much cars as there are today . But , the opposite could also occur . We can find evidences for and against both statements : On the one hand , the number of cars have increased at an important rate last years , at least in the country where I live ( Spain ) . The different sectors of the economy have had good results and the situation right now does n't make us think that things will change all of a sudden . So , the trend we have observed on cars growth could be remaining the same and make the total numbers of cars in twenty years beeing bigger than it is today . On the other hand , as cars are very polluting , lots of people have started being conscients about the damage we are causing to the environment and have started using public transports more often . In addition , governments are creating laws that restrict the use of a car in some cities or even they are taxing people who drive their cars in the city center . These facts could have as a result a reduction in the number of cars in the near and even the far future . Anyway , public transports are not usually as good as they should be and a lot of people , specially those who live in rural areas , do really need a car to go to work , go to the supermarket , etc . Using a car is something confortable and we all know that people like to be confortable . So , I wo n't go as far as to say that the number of cars in the future will be bigger for sure but , at least , that 's what I believe right now .
(JPN,high) In the modern society , things have changed dramatically every day , company owners or executives at companies who should categorized to be a successful people should pursue new things all the time to understand what customers need and where the current trend goes . I have been working as a personal assistant to the president for a Japanese company at the moment . He has started the company and told me that he went through so many hardships until he made the company successful . He mentioned that there are nothing you can gain if you do n't take any risks . Obviously , becoming successful involves a lot of risks to take . I believe that if you keep doing the same thing all the time , you feel comfortable and confident what you are doing but you do not gain anything much . Especially in the business world , if you stick to old idea all the time because you are afraid of changing , you could not expect to grow your business . If you like to become a successful business person , you have to read a lot of books to get wide range of knowledge , to try a lot of new things to keep yourself interested in something . New things which keep yourself being interested in do not have to be always business or politics but music or sports . By doing do , you can make a conversation to anyone such as your staff or your childre at any age and gender without feeling a barrier . After pursueing new things , some of them ended up becoming your hobby and your hobby brings some friends to share your common interest . I believe that people who is willing to challenge new things without worrying too much of taking some risks tend to be succesful because they tend to have positive attitude toward everything in their live that they are dealing with , while people who tend to stick to one thing that they are doing fine tend to be stable financially but never be successful .
(TUR,high) WILL IT BE EVER ENOUGH TO LEARN ? Life is a long and rough journey . Whatever we learn either good or bad throughout this journey will be a way of experience for us . I have always been sort of a greedy person . For me it is never enough for anything in life . I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because most important of all it increases a person 's self esteem and confidence . Actually , this question constitutes a major place in my life . It was the time when I have graduated from high school and was trying to choose what to study in the university . I am not the type who is obsessed with one issue and can spend his or her whole time with it . That is why I have chosen to study Sociology in the university . As a matter of fact , I did not know much about sociology at the time , but I knew that I wanted to study a course from which I could gain many things that I can fit into my real life . Sociology happens to be a subject that analyses the society , such a broader term . While analyzing the societies , of course we are concerned with many other types of information . Since my freshmen year , I have always preferred to choose courses from different majors such as , history , international relations , psychology , literature , economy , statistics and many more . The reason for this choice was because I have always believed that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . According to me , a person who is specialized in one specific topic is much more limited in life regarding his options . What I meant is that , if a person has a knowledge of many different academic subjects than this person always has a say in any conversation he or she engages into . Consequently , I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject because it increases self esteem and confidence and this way the person can have a lot to say in any conversation she or he engages into . Also , this person can easily understand the on going issues around the world and is capable of making clear on where he or she stands based on his thoughts and beliefs .
(GER,high) The issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad academic education or to specialize in certain academic disciplines or fields . On the one hand , there are good reason for a variety of academic experiences . If you receive a broader eduction , your academic background will help you to be able to work in different kind of job . For example , if somebody has not only studied medicine but business administration as well , this person will have a lot of opportunities on the job market . He or she can work in a clinic as well as in a consulting firm . Furthermore , different academic fields provide different approaches to solve problems or to describe the world . Being able to see several views , somebody will gain a general view of eduction and science . For example , a student who is a candidate for a degree in economics but who also does attend some extracurricular courses in psychology , will be able to better understand why poeple in economic theories act the way they do . On the other hand , it is neccessary to develop a certain profession . That is why somebody should focus on one academic discipline in particular . Today there is a very strong competition at the labor market . A student who does not specialize in one or two subjects probably will not be able to succeed in a highly competitive environment . For example recruiters of leading investment banks cannot employ somebody who does not have a detailed knowledge about certain topics . Moreover , time you spend on trying to get broad academic skills , cannot be used to spezialize in one particlur topic . This is a trade-off-problem . When I also attend extracurricular courses , there is - in consequence - less time to deal with those courses that are neccessary to receive a degree . This could also lead to the aspect that is mentioned above . Finally , after considering all these pros and cons , I feel that the very best is to focus on a certain academic discipline and to specialize . Maybe one extracurricular course can be attended each term . This will provide a solid education and good opportunities , but will use the broad supply of a college or a university in an effective way as well .
(HIN,high) I certainly agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are several reasons why I think that young people are making the most of their age while the older generation is gradually retiring from life except a selected few . According to me , the young generation is much active , able and resourceful to enjoy the life much better than the older generation . Today 's youth has tremendous opportunity to make the most of life and they are grabbing this opportunity to make their life better each day . In contrast , the older people has much less resources and opportunities to enjoy life . Basically , the concept of life and enjoyment has changed totally since the past years . Nowadays enjoyment is considered to be a part of daily activities and some time is kept aside for that . But the older generation is not used to such modern ideas and life for them at an advanced age is full of miseries , complaints and troubles . Today , young people are healthy and they keep their fitness levels up by carrying out a well planned regime . As the age advances , the older people can not maintain a healthy lifestyle and ultimately face many health related problems which cause a hinderance for them to enjoy life . Imagine how a 60 or 70 year old female will travel to some hill station or let her hair down in a party when she cant even let her foot down from the bed due to age related diseases like osteoarthritis in her knees ? Nowadays , the younger generation are indulging in work and pleasure equally , thus , balancing all the necessary walks of life . They plan every weekend to a new destination either a movie or some exotic location after a long and tiring week . The disco and the party culture is a hype among the youth today which are not an older generation commodity . Finally , much depends on how you take life in general . Because as Norman Vincent Peale mentions in his book ` Power of Positive Thinking ' that a positive outlook towards life is much important to lead an enjoyable and successful life and todays youth are walking on his foot steps leaving everything else far behind .
(TEL,low) Yes , i agree that young people do not give enough time to help their community because they are more involved in their accademic schedule and they have got no time to serve the community due to their involvment in their jobs and other freak outs . Now a days the accademic schedule is so fixed that the young people are not getting time to spend with the society and are busy with their lessons , projects , etc . As the proverb says `` untill we care one none cares us '' . The part time jobs play an important role to earn money . They are the major source of money today . so young people spend their extra time in part time jobs than helping the community , thinking of the money not about the society . Not remembering that `` service to the society is service to the nation '' . Even the self enjoyment and freakouts got major importance in over comming once stress . so young people prefer it rather than serving the community . becauswe entertainment is getting prevailed in this modern world . I finally conclude that younge people nowadays do not give enought time to help their community .
(ITA,medium) In the past young people helped their family in many activities such as houseworks , in crops and they were very important for the life and the survive of family . They had not the possibility to go to school because there were not much money to do this types of activities . In this conditions they were able to help their communities in different works because they had more time to spend to do this thing . Nowadays the rythme of life is changed . Life style of youngs is different in compare with the past . They go to school where they do many activities . In the afternoon they do homeworks and usually they do some sport . These activities are only for future or amusement of them . So they can not help community in a good way . For example , in my family we are three children . My brother works all the day , my sister studies and I , for the moment , I am looking for job and so I have a few time to spend for community . In free time I prefer to relaxe . The situation is different from the past because nowadays there are too much things to do . In my opinion , helping community is important for all people but if there are not possibilities to collaborate with members that are in a community , it is right that government helps the society and its member to organize different and interesting activities for all people .
(ARA,high) Media has become the fastest and most efficient way for advertising . With the availability of the technological means , any product may be advertised adjustly in order to meet each client 's needs and expectations . Some advertisements are even spread worldwide and translated to different languages to serve the audience . It is clearly undoubtful that each company always tries its best to present the product it wants to sell in the best way possible . Not only because it is esential to promote the product , but also because its the company 's right . However , what is not part of it 's rights , is to lie about a product . Most advertisements show their product to be the best one ever yet , and always shows that the product serves directly and perfectly its original purposes . The new trend is to have celebrities acting in the clip , attractive women , and special effects and backgrouds , and all of this is fine . Its very pleasant to watch well done advertisements and its always delightful to hear that there 's finally a product that will allow one not have wrinkles before the age of sixty ; however , its very disappointing when one actually tries it and doesnt get the expected results . The problem nowadays is that the competition is too high . Of course with the presence of media and the availability of easy and fast means of transportation , a company finds itself competing not only on a local scale , but also internationally , and this could be and most definitely is a threat . By promoting the product properly , which usually results in making it seem way better than it really is , the company stands a chance in the market , and has a better opportunity to sell . Of course these reasons do n't make it alright for advertisements to be a complete lie , because most of them really are , but this is how business works these days , and marketing or advertisement are increasingly being wanted and needed .
(KOR,medium) I concur what the statement says . Since i went to a lots of countries in many different kinds of ways , the best experienced i had was to travel as in a group led by a tour guide . When I was eleven years old , i went to Phillippines with my family and we thought we would have fun not chasing by time becuase usually with groups we are chased by time . But throughout the trip , since it was our first time visiting Phillippines , we did n't know any places so just looking for the good places , we spent one day just researching for places . The following day , my parents borrowed a car and we bought a map but then it was hard to get to the place because all the poplular places were far away . There were always full of people and there was traffic jams , when we got to the place , my dad was all ready tired . But if have gone with a tour guide , since guide knows where to go and about the places , he will explaing to us about that places and give us great information . Those are the reasons why i like to go trip as in a group led by a tour guide . Travelers do n't have to drive and we can look at the views in relaxed mood . We go to trip to have comfortable and have exciting time and we go to travel to get away from our normal same day lives . What is the point of going to travel , if we are having tired days like as normal days ? Also , if we go as a group , we get to meet a lots of new people with diffrent chracteristics . I am outgoing and social so it was always fun to meet new people . In conclusion , i again agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Traveling in as a group is a best thing to do !
(ARA,low) No i'am not agree cause whin you specilized in one specific subject you will be more stong in asubject that you choose , and that give you a good experionse and specilized in a good & one work . An academic subject make you going in the deep of the subject tht you prefere to study , so because of that it will give you alot of answers that you was wondering or thinking in it before . After finding your answering your knoledg , you will gitting start to begin your life way that you draw to your self . so it will be a fantasting way to shown up your dreem and make it come true . When the exciting begin ? The exciting will began for you when you relly start to work in your major study that youspicilzed in , you will love your work < love your life , and you will to forget you proplem and solve it or starting anew life style if we can say .
(SPA,high) Being successful in life is something that we all desire , unluckily only a few ones will manage to get it . Personally , I think that success depends on many things and not only on taking risks because if you want to be the number one on something , you need to be born with certain skills , give the best of you and to make an important sacrifice . Some people may agree in saying that being succesful means to break the rules , However you can not break any rule if you do not know how rules work first . I mean , if you want to be the best at playing soccer , you need to know that there are certain rules that you are suppose to follow , like team work , solidarity , understanding your mates etc . in this case , to think that you will become the best football player in the world by doing whatever you want and not paying any attention at all to any recomendation is absolutely nonsense . Obviously , when you behave like this , you are taking a risk , but that risk is ridiculous and naive . I wholeheartedly believe that if you ever dream of being a successfull man , sometimes you will have to take a risky step , but that step can not be taken without having the previous knowledge about something or withouth being fully aware of the consequences . The fact that we live in a society that everyday demands more and more , makes us think that if we do not gain sucess we are nothing . Nevertheless , success is not a matter of being the best at something , but being the best in all these small things that we do in our everyday life . To conclude , if you want to be successful take risk , but do not let this risk destroy your whole life .
(GER,medium) On of the big topics in this new century is the pollution of our world , especcially of the air . To give our children a chance to live healthy on this world , the are some possibilities to the air pollution : one of the most factors causes air pollution are our cars . So a lot of states and countries think about strategies to increase the sum of cars in the next 20 years . They invest money in new and more economic bus - , train - or tube-systems . To use this transport system in the future has got a second advantage , too . In every bog city , there is a parking-problem . But the cities are rising , too . And so every month a parking place chances to a new building . In future more and more people wo n't have an other possiblity for arriving their jobs than to use this public transport systems . So the cars will be less at our streets . Another reason to disagree with this statement is the oil . In some years , there wo n't be as much oil as today at our earth and therefore the petrol price will rice to regions much people wo n't be able to pay for . Ok , there are inventions for non-petrol cars . But nobody really support that because of the big influence of the oil industry . So a lot of people will sell their cars and move with public systems or trains . A third reason to disagree is that there will be new kinds of transportation-systems in 20 years . Perhaps everybody has got a small plane . We wo n't have any streets . Only fly on the magnetic field of our earth without any petrol or electicity . Or we get beamed to every place on earth like in `` Spaceship Enterprice '' ? 20 years , that 's a very long time , and looking back to the last 20 years , a lot of things , nobody thought about , has been invented . We only need someone who invents this kinds of transport system , and then , I 'm sure , nobody wo n't use something like a CAR ! Because of this main reasons , I must disagree with the statement and can look hopefully into the future with clean air for us , our children , ...
(ARA,medium) Well , my openion about this subject is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . And its not just about time that they dont have , its that they dont have the `` will '' , as they say `` if there is a `` will '' there is a `` must '''' . Nowadays young people that are between 15-25 their minds are only settled on playing as a major idea , then studying as a second , and ofcourse beign a center of attraction in any king of subject . In soccer for example , at our school student especially ages between 15 and 18 , they do their best just to achive there goal of eighther being the centre of attraction , or that he hates the other team or a player in the other team . And some student like to be the `` The Fashion Boy '' , that he wears every new brand that has come down , eigther its nice or bad , `` ITS FASHION '' , also as old men the say `` tailors do not make men '' . Well lets say 10 % of these young people alittle bit of time to help their communities by working hard and studying in order to achive a goal . To put a goal in your life , in the future of your own , your your family , is the main idea of life . Putting a goal in your life will lead you to the best , and whatever right you do , you will have confidence in your self , and what you do now will reflect the life of your family ( kids and wife ) , as my father always say : The more you do , the more you get . Well ill talk about my self and goals in that limited life in just a few words , my goal im this life is to be the best architect in the world ( well thats what i say , atleast in town ) , And thats my last year in school , and im trying my best to get hight marks inorder to go to the university that i want , and have a nice and happy life .
(HIN,medium) Method of studying is always different from student to student . Many people hold their perspective to undestand ideas and concept while other prefer to learn facts . I too beileve that it is more important for student to understand concept and ideas than to learn facts . The reason , I think this way is because understanding ideas and concept clearity increase the creativity of student and it gives better knowledge for further growth . Concept clearity and clear ideas provide better foundation for future education of student . One reason , I believe that concept clearity and clear ideas give better foundation to a student is because if we understand ideas and concept then we never forget the subject . Take my own example , When I was student I always preferred to concept clearity . I still remember the concept of Newton 's Laws ; because my physics teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about this subject . Therefore it is always better to clear the concept and ideas so that we will never forget the same . Another reason , I believe that concept clearity and understanding ideas is important is that it increase the creativity of student . When we understand the concept of any theory then we feel more innovative to discover some more things . In fact every scientific discovery was started from fifferent ideas . For example , When Adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then only he could concluded that electrons can be used to flow electricity . This is how understanding concept about atom lead to the discovery of electricty . All these are not to say that to learn facts are all use less . Facts are related to generally past which is also important . But advantages of learning facts can not surpass the advantages of clearing concept and understanding ideas . In short , In this scientific world , student with capability of learning ideas and with clear concept has better future than those who learn fact only
(TUR,medium) Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject seems more difficult to me due to several reasons . Let me state my reasons . First of all , specializing in one specific event or subject may take a lifetime . I , for instance , want to specialize in marketing and in order to do so , I will have to have my MBA , PhD and still work on learning . I can not say that '' OK , I have been reading and learning about marketing for 20 years and I know everything . '' This is impossible because evey year , new books and new methods are introduced to the market . Learning about one subject never ends up . Secondly , it is not useful to know more than one topic or subject on the surface . You may have knowledge about other topics but you do one thing good . It is like playing basketball and football at the same time . It would be impossible for you to find enough time to sacrifice yourself for the well being of any issue . If this topic was possible , I would have one techer in my whole life , trying to teach me everything . But I had math . teacher , marketing teacher , finance teacher and so on . All were specialized in their fields and had depth knowledge of their intererst . To sum up , having broader knowledge of many academic subjects seem unuseful to me . Specializing is much more prefered . In USA , the biggest economy in the world today , specialization at universities is the primary method and they owe their success to this approach . I would go for specialization .
(TEL,medium) I strongly agree on the statement that young people are enjoying there life than older once . As per the changing of the time the people have to change . In the older days there were be certain restrictions given to stop things tobe done which give lot of happiness . Consider the situation of my parents . They have certain to point out , many restrictions over there life 's . The education what my grandfather insist to study , my father continued . But it is different in my condition , i have my own views to which i can and i do probably . In the same way many cases , consider another example in which older peole are not that much free to their children , as the thing they missed lot of things to share to their parents for example some college situations . But the children now are enjoying each and every moment of their college life with their co-students and sharing the things to parents and commenting . And the other more is improvement of technology . In olden days there were not any amusement parks , recreation clubs , theatres and stuff like that . But the improvement of technology gave lot of fun over life . The younger people are able to enjoy themselves by going to parks , recreation clubs , parties along with friends and tours . And the tours will give lot of fun along with the information about the places where people are going . In this way i can give the examples like this to tell many things and the young people are having the ability to do there things of their own with fun , but previously people have to depend on some one to complete any work which they want to do . So i strongly agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
(TUR,medium) Being A Successful person I agree with the statement . The feeling of success is a great thing that is unresistable to have it again . When a person is successful then he/she is happy and pleasant , so the ones who tasted the success before , wants it again and again inspite of the failures or risks . The successful people are brave , they know and believe that the success is not impossible , it may be tough or risky but they know that the feeling at the end of the success worths everything . So when this person is up to a risky situation , he/she does n't hesitate to try it . Risk is a way , for this person to reach the success . But of course , this person may not be always so lucky , he/she can also taste being unsuccessful , he/she can taste the unhappiness . I think this makes that person more ambitious , more hardworking . Next time he/she will be more powerfull for this situation , ready for next round . Doing always the same things makes us bored and it is the same for success . Successful people get bored of doing the thing that they already know how to do well . It is not a new thing for them and they are n't as happy as they were at the first time they succeed it . They start to look for new or may be risky things . Becuase the things that we do n't know well are risky for us . And risk is attractive for people who are looking for new successes . For example , when a successful student gets a bad mark , he/she does n't give up , works harder until he/she becomes successful and also looks for every opportunity inorder to try to be successful , this means risks . In addition to that if the successful student becomes successful again in another subject , he/she finds another subject to try to be successful . Finally , i can say that successful people are unsatisfactory , ambitious and hardworking people . They love risks and new things , and never give up after failures . They do n't satisfacted by doing that they know to do well . They keep on searching for new and more success . This means being a successful person .
(SPA,medium) I disagree with the statement . In my opinion the best way to travel is alone by yourself . Travelling alone you can wander for many places knowing the culture of the place that you visit . Also you can spend your time with native people who show you the identity of such society . When I go abroad I try to travel alone because you can know the culture and the way of life of the people . If you travel with a tour guide you could probably know about the history of the place or other topics that you can read in a book . When you travel alone you can wander for several places not only to the common places such as landscapes or museums . You can walk throughout the city without a fixed schedule visiting the places that you want . I like to travel alone instead of travel in a group . If a travel alone I can spend a lot of time knowing native people . I can share their customs or their way of life and learn the native language as well . When you travel in a group you should do anything that the majority want . If you travel in groups you would spend more time with your group than native people . I have visited several countries and I have tried to spend most of my time with native people . I believe that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guide or travel in a group . If you travel alone you can learn the culture of such place like a native . You can know many issues that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group . I like to travel alone because I can spend a lot of time with native people knowing their problems and thier way of life . Therefore , I prefer to travel alone by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
(FRE,medium) Generaly , young people think that they know how to enjoy life and to have fun . They think that there are more ways to have fun when you are young than when you are older because most of the time when your are young you dont have a lot of responsabilities and you have more time to think about yourself because you dont have a family and so on ... So young people are free to go out at night , to travel , to sleep late in the morning ( and sometimes even in the afternoon ) because they wont have to wake up on sunday morning to take care of the children . They dont have to save money for the projects of the family and they can waste all their money for themselves . But youth is not eternal and one day they will have to think about the future . And when the time will come for them to grow up and have a different way of life with a family and responsabilities they may realise that they were wrong , and that they are still enjoying life and having fun but in a diffrent way . They will enjoy the moments they will spend with their family and they will be proud of their new houses , cars ... They will be able to enjoy familial holidays and of course in their jobs they will have improved and get more income to be able to have new projects . But when all this is over ? It is not the end at all , elderly people have an important advantage for enjoying life : experience . They know more places , more people and more ways to have fun than anybody else . Actually , I think that you dont have to be young to enjoy life . You can enjoy life at any age . In different ways , it is up to you , and it depends on your character and your personnality .
(ARA,medium) what i think about this case is goin for the first choise which is , its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because when a person have that knowledge about the academic subjects other than in one specific subject , sure a person would have a job which has a one specific subject for exampel , a doctor , his feild or his main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and body since in general , but that dose not mean he only have to know what about his job only , well whats wrong about haveing knowledge about other things for example , a knowledge of art , how great is to find a doctor wich his clinic is full of his art work or some he bought in his own taste of art , a normal person if he walks in a place like that he would say that this doctor is not like any other doctor . having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it , it can be very help ful in some positions , for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing , and they all have a knowledge about many academic subjects exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have , what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject , what his position would be like , and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his , after that , that person would think that he was wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it , from that stuiations people change their minds about what they have made . so for not being in that kind of positions i agree and 100 % support having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
(ARA,medium) `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , agree or disagree ? what a difficuilt question . Thinking of the answers puts you in a closed circule , there is no definite one . `` Enjoying life '' is not dependent only on the factor of age , despite that we say that `` inorder to enjoy life you have to feel young from inside '' , for my opnion age is one of the least essential effects . To approve with this statemant or not , first we have to clearify what is the interpretation of `` enjoy life '' . I think that we do all agree that it differs from one individual to the another , depending on their characters , their goals in life , their aspects , opnions .. etc . Talking of my self , enjoying life means to me : travelling through the world , to be in everywhere in the world and not only to pass by also to learn from it , to be interested in any new thing including every single field in life , to enjoy means to work hard on improving yourself , your socio-economic level , your intellegence , your personality , to enjoy means to introduce new people , because knowing new people encounters you with their life experinces , and that enriches your experince , and your thinking , your mind . For me practicing all these things is `` ENJOYNG LIFE '' , and not doing them means , for me , your are not living .
(ITA,medium) As I 'm Italian , I can maintain that this statement is probabilly wrong : actually , my personal experience shows that the trend is the opposite . When I was a child , there were only one car per family and you could have seen the same situation when my parents were young . If you have lived in the early-Fourties of the last century , probabilly you could n't afford a car : only rich people had one . Now , let 's take a look at today situation , cars are everywhere ! I do n't want to condemn this trend - I own a car too - but that 's a matter of fact and , I think , in the future it will be one of the main issue in every politician 's agenda . You can find many reasons to explain why everyone wants a car , nevertheless I 'm virtually sure that it is due to the difficult to travel around with trains , buses and taxis - and the latter are very expensive here in Italy . If you have a date , surely you do n't wish to be late , but if you take a train , you could never know when you arrive nor if you arrive in the right place . I think it 's time to introduce an example . Today there is my TOEFL test , nonetheless public drivers have made up their minds to strike . Unless I would come here by feet , I was obliged to drive my car . You have to consider that such a situation happens about twice a month for buses , twice a month for trains , twice a month for planes ; surely it 's not surprising the fact that people prefer to go to work with thair own cars . Even if your family is small , as my family is , you need at least two cars , because your father has to go to work in time and you do n't want to be late for your university course . To summarize , I do n't think that cars will be fewer in the next years and surely we will have to cope with pollution . If politicians want to stop this trend , they are requested to improve public transports , as buse , for example . But I-m sure that this will not happen in a few years .
(GER,high) I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . First of all , I think there is almost no profession only dealing with one academic subject . For example , if you study English literature , you also need historical , cultural and linguistic knowledge to be successful in understanding your own subject . Or if you plan to become a Physicist , you need extented knowledge in biology , chemistry and especially mathematics . Furthermore , to be specialized in only one subjects causes remarkable difficulties in private as well as public life . Your relationships will be limited to people of your own specific subjects and you are not able to connect or communicate with other people because you cannot understand them and vice versa . If you talk to a Biologist who does not know anything about any other topics , you will not be able to talk to him because there is nothing that connects you . The most important argument for favoring a broad knowledge rather than a very specific one is very personal . For me it is very important to gain a broad general knowledge because I think people with limited specific knowledge also have a limited emotional ability . I am sure that people who read a lot of different kinds of texts can much easier relate to the problems of other people than people who tend to read texts exclusively dealing with one subject . People with knowledge of many subjects can understand situations although they will never have to face them , whereas people with restricted knowledge will not be able to deal with those situations because they are beyond their limited horizon . In conclusion I may say that a broad knowledge of many subjects makes more sense than to specialize in one specific subject . People belonging to the first group have advantages in many different situations , such as academical , professional , interactional as well as emotional ones , as stated above .
(TUR,high) I think being youmg means to be able to do things more easily and freely . When you are young , you are less responsible and you have more energy and the feeling of excitement for life . Hence , I do agree with the statement saying that ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ' To illustrate my opinion we can compare some family members . The parents are responsible for both their lives and their children 's lives . So , they can not move free from their children . For example they can not go to holidays without considering their children . They should find a solution about their youngs . Also , they should take permission from their work . On the other hand , children can easily go to holidays by just taking their parents ' permission , although sometimes they even do not do this . They are more free to do the things they want to . If we think about the couples just married , the situation is not too different again . Once you begin to work . you become a member of real life dealing with real problems to survive and you forget about the beautiful parts of living . You are so surrounded with the problems that you become having a monotone life full of problems . However , when you are young , you do not have to earn money to survive . Your family supports you financially . Youngs also have responsibilities like finishing school , but they have more free time compared to older people . You just care about school-based problems and friendship-based problems . Life is mostly full of enjoyment for you . You are not still aware of the real life problems even you hear about them . Most of the time you just think of your own pleasure . Another thing is that , the older you become , the less energetic you are . To enjoy life , you should have the desire of living . When you are younger you are more inexperienced and you aer not aware most of the bad parts of living . Thus , you want to do every enjoyable thing . However , as you become older you are bored of living since you have experienced lots of bad things and so you think that life is not very enjoyable . In sum , I really believe that young people enjoy life more than the older people because young people are more energetic and less responsible and they see just the enjoyable part of the world .
(GER,medium) I agree with this statement because at the begining of every inovation stay ideas and concepts . Without them you can learn nothing about facts . This statement can be best described on the example of the begin of a carrear . If you are new in the company and you are chalenging with new tasks and maybe problems which you have to solve . What would help you ? You have to start with analysing the problem . This implies that you have understood the concept . After this you can try to develop ideas which could lead you to solution . And only at the end you will use the facts to come up to the solution . Another aspect wich confirms this statement is the fact that that the facts are always available . You can get the facts from books , from internet and from another different sources but there are no sources for ideas . If it would be so than there would be a lot of reach people . So the main aim of every study should be the ability of developing ideas . This is also the main feature which makes difference between university and scool . The fact are the contents and only helpfeaters which you use to realise your ideas .
(ARA,medium) Nowadyas , every one wants to make an advertisment for every thing that he has . Ths is because it is a very helpful way to let people know about what you have , and what it looks like . Advertisements are a way that helpe people to know some information about the products , but a lot of peple exagorate in advertising about their products . Some people do n't know a lot about the itmes that they want , and they buy them without knowing any information about them unless when they read an advertisment . For example , when some one want to buy a computer , he may read something about it and then he goes to buy it . He may not find the right person to ask about what he wants to buy , so he believes what is written on the advertisments . On the other hand , some companies take this thig as awy to help them in selling their products . They may make a lot of advertisments to let people buy what they have . It is imprtant to have someone has an experions in some cases because companies like to exagorat in their products . When you want to buy something you sould buy something reasonable , or you should ask some that he knows about what you are buying . In my case , when I want to buy a computer I ask my borther about it because he is very good in computers , and he knows every thing about them . It is importnat to buy something that you know because you are not going to know about it till you buy it . Companies sould care about how the people feel when they buy their products because when they do this they are not going to exagorate in their products . On the other hand people should know what they are buying beucase it is safer for their money .
(CHI,high) I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . In out real life , although we often travel with a tour guide , it is more fun to discover the excitment covered by the mask of the place you visit all by yourself . Some of you might say that it is more fun to travel with a tour since you are not familiar with the place you are going to , but what I think is that traveling with a tour actually does n't give you more information about the local buildings or spot you are visiting than just travel by yourself . If a finalized , perfect travel has to be accomplished , one has to collect all the information one needs and starts the unmasking discovery adventure not just paying lots of money and have to waiting for the buses in the morning and later found out that someone has troubles with the payment and the schedule is delayed . Traveling with a guide tour usually has no personal space during the schedule . Going with people scrambling together cannot genrantee your individual actions might be appropriate to others . You might want to do some break dances during the break or listen to the music loudly , but there is always someone in your group might disagree with your actions . You might experience peacefulness while you are along , and so does traveling . If you travel with a group , you might have to endure the noise surrounding you since there are people talking or doing their personal stuff that you probably would explode and start complaining ; on the other hand , if you travel along , the problem does not exist anymore . Accidents has more chances to happen between people than a person along , according our history that mobs are usually the headache of the government and accidents happen more frequently within the unstable group . So if one traveled along , he might get a happy trip after the day off , but if one traveled with a group led by a tour guide , there absolutely will be accidents such as people missing , people fighting , or someone falls into the water and break his leg . The last benefit provided by traveling along is no time restriction . Since it is all by your own , you are the tour guide , it is you who decided where the trip is taking place and how the trip is going to be . Traveling along has more benefits than traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide .
(ARA,medium) i do strongly agree with folloing statment , i think it is very important for the students to fully understand the ideas and the concepts of the subject or the topic befor learning the facts . i belives this way for several resones , first of all , learning the the concept of any topic will allow the student to learn the facts of this matter in many different way and memorize them in better way , for example in a mathmetical class , if the teacher starts giving the student a formulaes to solve some problems without explaning to them how we got the formulaes with approval , it would be very had for the students to learn the best ways of solving problems , eventhough somtimes students can get the answer right , but giving a fact without the maim concepts will not add to the students information . another example why i think is good to know some of the concept about the topic befoer learnig the fact , it is more enjoyable to know the whole story 's concept befor you get to the end of it , for instance in you are taking a history class , it is more fun to go hear about many stories befor you get to some facts happen in the past history . learning the ideas and the concepts of any subject will also improve any student wayes of thinking , it will devolope a wider imagenation and skills of thinking which helpe them in their real life . in conclusion , students will enjoy , memorize , devolope the skillesof thier thinking and learn the material much more better by going through some of the idea and the concepts befor learning the fact .
(FRE,high) In whatever lesson , we learn ideas , concepts and facts . Ideas present the topic and facts are an application of these ideas . I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts . The way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand ideas and concepts and then , understand facts . It 's not reversible . For example , in history class about World War One , you have to understand why this war took place and why all the countries were involved in this fight before learning facts : battles , events , great names , famous days ... Another example happens in mathematics class , you see that a theorem can be applied to particular cases but you should have understod before all the concepts which are used in the theorem . Secondly , I think that , in a lesson , ideas and concepts are more significant than simple facts . Indeed , facts are just applications of ideas . I mean that without ideas and concepts , you ca n't totaly understand a lesson . You can partially , of course , but it 's not the same . I ca n't really explain it but you feel differently when you 've understood all . I feel kind of victorious when all is clear in my head . You ca n't get all the details explained if you 've just learnt facts because they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic . At last , what is the point of a lecture or a lesson if you just remember facts ? Facts ca n't exist without ideas or concepts whereas ideas and concepts do n't have to be related to facts to exist . I know it sounds weird but some fields of knowledge such as metaphysics do n't really have any applications . However , they exist . Besides , we always can extract an idea from a fact , whereas the opposite is n't as easy as we think . For all these reasons , I think that students should understand ideas and concepts before learning facts .
(TUR,medium) CARS IN TWENTY YEARS Today 's world is changing rapidly and during this change people invent lots of new things that makes life easier . Once cars were a dream and now it is almost impossible for a man to travel without them , but what about twenty years from now ? Will they become ancient history or will it still be very important ? Cars will continue to be important for daily life however it is possible that the number of cars that will be used diminish . There are many reasons for that , such as , people became more aware about environmental issues and since one of the major causes of air pollution is the usage of cars so in the future people may use less cars and more of buses or trains , it will also be helpful for traffic jam because roads are not sufficient anymore to handle all the cars . Second reason why the cars may be less used is the technology is growing very fast , as mentioned above the cars were also a dream which came true , so in the future it is possible that scientist may invent something new that costs cheaper and move faster so people start buying these things and cars will be less used and their number may diminish . One other thing about cars is : today cars are seen as a person 's wealth . The more money one has the number of cars or the luxury of the cars increases too , so it is some kind of a fashion show . If this idea changes people will stop buying new cars and the number of cars that will be used become fewer . As a result , it is very possible for the number of cars to diminish in the future , due to several reasons , however it is not possible for them to get entirely out of human daily life . At least not in a twenty year period .
(FRE,medium) Everybody would agree to say that technology is the that upgrades the fatest . The authomobile market is the perfect illustration of this evolution . New products are created everyday as new materials are invented . The aim of all this is to make our life easier and comfortable . In a first part we 'll see what the researchers are looking for in the perfect car . In the second part , we will analyze the consumers expectations . Finally , we 'll discuss about the chances of the car uses to increase . On the one hand , the research and development departement of every car company is working really hard on different problems . The major problems to solve are all the car skill which are : mostly all the car 's competences and qualities in a technic aspect and the energy use of the car that as to be less costy and less destroying towards the environnement and the human beings ' health . On the second hand , the main issue of the car use is its effects on the environnement . Nowadays people 's mindset is focusing more on such international matters as the global warming and the green house effetc . They would like to use cars that are not attempting to nature then they are looking for a good price . Of course the cheaper cars will be , the more they will be bought . Which brings us to the question , will people buy more cars in the future ? In my opinion , the answer to this question is obvious . People will try to get more and more cars because of the advantages they provide . Not mentionning that the prices are getting lower as cuncurrency is becoming harder and technologies even more performant . In conclusion , the consumer rule . Awhile , governments will try to reduce the
(KOR,medium) People have their own ideas about whether they concentrate on the broad sujects or not . Some people may say that we have to study special subject for developing speciality . In my opinion , however , it seems clear that learning many subjects is more important than the sepcific subject because of selection and relation of job . First , when it comes to the selection of job , knowing a lot of fields enables people to have many options which they select jobs . It is generally agreed that if we study more subject , we would gain more items of considering occupations . For example , in my case , I majored in environment and I am soldier , in other words , I studied environment as major and explained army skill . Therefore , I can select my future whether I would be a soldier or environmentalist . Moreover , if people have so many selection , they would fail to live in their life . Therefore , the so many selection have positive effect on studentrs . Second , as far as relation of jobs is concerned , some jobs are relative to other jobs , People have the common sense that math is similiar to physics , science , engineering and so on . Therefore , all subects are relative to any other subjects and we can say that the some occupations also similiar to other jobs . For instance , if people want to be a computer specialist , they should understand engineerinig workers and investors and also know math , science , engoneer and so on . In other words , computer science involve in engineering , math , science and other fields . Furthermore , in the companies , persons who work at same corporation have each major and they have influence on each other . Therefore , they must know respective fields for developing their company . In this way we can say that we must understand many fields . To sum up , I agree with the statements in that we had better gain more knowledges from learning lot of subjects . If we study many academic subjects , we can obtain so many benefits , All things considered , I can definitely say that we must study many subjects .
(SPA,high) Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ? Or is it better to specialize in one specific subject ? Tricky questions . I would have to say that it depends , they both have their cons and pros . For example , when you 're in high school , which is my case , you definitely should have knowledge of all the academic subjects that you need in order to graduate and pass on to your next step in life , which is college . But once you get to college , for example , why would you need to know advanced math when you do n't want to study anything related to it ? You would just be wasting your time and money . Right now , I 'm required to know , at least a little , about everything , from ancient history to the meaning of the mathematical term pi . But sometimes I find myself asking : will I ever use this again in my life ? Why should I learn all these things if I do n't want to study anything related to it ? But then there are some other times when , for example , my younger sister comes to me with a school problem and I can help her because I 've learned those things before . Sometimes we can be very lazy and only learn what is presented to us at the moment . But then there are the times when we want to know everything . Like for example , when we are kids , that everything our mothers do we question them why . Why this and why that , and there never seems to be an answer to all of a our questions . Going back to the questions , a pro of knowing about different subjects is that you actually know about pretty much anything . This makes it easier to have a conversation with another person and even to get a boyfriend . A con is that maybe you 've spend way too much time doing your research and when you realize it a part of your life has gone by . A pro of specializing in only one specific subjetc is that you can be better at what you do . A con is that you wo n't have so many things to talk about with someone outside of what you do . To summarize this entire thing , I definetely think that everyone should have knowledge of basic information and subjects and even read the newspaper , at least once in a while , and be educated , but have more knowledge on your field of study and that way you can be the best professional that you can be .
(HIN,medium) I agree with the statement as these era people have comparitively less time as to the era which has passed by . This era 's young people have more involvement in other tasks . They generally have more of tasks to complete than the hours in a day . In todays fast living life young people generally have lots to do as they have their social life to be maintained , as well as religious life to be handled , or lets say a peer group life . Their a certain things which a community asks for , lets say their helping towards society uplifting or making a change in the community as the time changes . As these young people need to handle their community and their outside world well enough to have a balance in thier life . community as welll should be quiet adoptive to a young people manner . As these community too should allow changes in them as the time changes or the era of people change as these factors can only attract young people to the community . Young people have more to the places like pubs or disc or any other fast running places as these youngsters do generally copy the things which facinates them more . As these things or places have a attractive outlook which makes the young or any age group follow them . the fact to be considered here is how to bring these people 's intrest in community task , as it can be done by the parents as setting a good example in front of them and to teach them the right things or rituals from the begining so they follow accordingly and help to continue . These young people are normaly ready to be molded as you mold them they will be moulded , the community has to be the one to moulding the people in their molds . As i generally feel that the intrest among these youngsters is to be brought from within and not from saying or asking as this should from the soul and this can be done by building their community closer as these youngsters are the one to follow are community to the future gener and if they dont their will be an era where communities would be rare to find .
(GER,medium) I would agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays . This is a result of the ongoing process of enstranging . People do not want to know their fellow people anymore . Today no one knows who his neighbour is . This is mainly a result of the increasing independence people enjoyed during the last decades . So why should younger people be different when the society has taught them to be this way . Young people are also not that political engaged like previous generations . One reason might be the huge amount of additional leisure offers you can choose from . You are mobile , so you can get to a disco or cafe at the evening . Young people play at their PC or Playstation . And that is more fun than getting involved in a party . But younger peoples are also tired of politics nowadays . They do not see politicians as role models that encourage them to take the same career . Politicians are boring , they are said to lie all the time and they serve not the interest of teenagers but of adults . What is natural as most young people are not allowed to vote and so they are not interesting for politicians . Furthermore young people are very reluctant to work volunteerely for charity organizations . I do not think that it is because young people do not care about these issues anymore but they are to busy to earn money with holiday jobs or similar activities to afford the things they always wanted to buy . That is why we live in a society that is dedicated to consume all the time . Even little kids are seduced via commercials in TV or radio to buy the products they actually do not need . For young people it is more important to have all the new stuff their friends have and that is why they do not have time to get involved in a charity organization .
(TEL,high) I will agree to the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . If we learn ideas and understand concepts then we can question those ideas which would lead to new way of thinking and lead to discover new things . If we learn facts then there is nothing much to change either you know the answer or you do not , but if you new the concept that leads to the fact then the student would use that concept to arrive at the answer . For example if the student wanted to know the circumference of a pentagon then if the student only learned facts the he may have forgotten the equation , but if a student knew that circumference of any object was the total length of the sides then he can add the length of each side and get the answer . The importance of education is not in knowing the capitals of all countries nor in learning the entire science book by heart but to use , what the student has learned in the school , in his every day life , to better his life , to use it when faced with a challenge and come out winning . Learning facts may help you sometimes in your life but completely understanding the subject will always help you . There are six basic questions to everything - when ? where ? why ? how ? what ? which ? If you knew the answer to only one question then the education would be incomplete , only by understanding the entire concept will the student know all the answers and the exact meaning of a subject . lastly on a broader note , for a society to evolve and progress in culture and education we need new ideas , new concepts because if we do not develop new ideas we would still believe that Earth was flat and was the center of the universe , this way of thinking would have had a detrimental effect on humans as a whole and we would still be living like animals .
(GER,medium) In my opinion successful people are more related in trying new things but they are not necessarily more atraccted in taking risks . The reason for my thought is that people who are successful normaly lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business . Therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm . For example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new , lets say , a new car . The car works with a new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested good yet and will probably not make much money . In my opinion the business leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest . Because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed . Nevertheless I think that successfull people are more willing to try new things . They probably develop new things and also give impulses for future . That means that they are pre - thinkers of future ideas . In spite of my opinion I could imagine that there are successful people who take risks . These people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care of the people who depend on their decisions . Another topic to talk is the possibility to take risks in there free time , like a hobby . When something worse happens they will just be risponsable for themselves , expect they have children and wife . In conclusion I would say that successfull people tend to be more risk loving than others but they should be aware of their responsibility .
(ARA,medium) `` The more you know the better '' . I do agree with the statement that a person must enrich his knowledge with many academic programs to enable him to achieve a greater level of success and finally be a well educated person . A person who is familiar with a number of different subjects or rather topics , is more able to communicate with the world around . Furthermore , the individual will practice and enjoy the essence of the material he studied when it comes to implementing it in real life situations . To start with , as a fact , a person 's area of knowlege is unlimited , people can study alot of different subjects , if they have the will to do so . A person for example , who enriches his area of knowlege will be able to reach new sophisticated levels in life . The world around us in dynamic , it changes rapidly and people are not aware of that . A broad level of knowlege will help the person coupe with such changes , allowing him to understand and communicate with different people from different areas of the world . Knowlege is not only limited to only particular subject . Moreover , when you study a subject and do understand all important information as well as the idea behind the information given , then when it comes to real life situations and you have to implement what you studied , the feeling that you have achieved something great will cross your mind , and so you will be more keen to actually continue what you are doing inorder to achieve the greatest . To sum up , i beleive that all individuals are able to develop the area of their knowledge and to widen their horizon about the the many things taking place in life , because at the end it is you that will benefit from becoming successful . Learning is never to late .
(JPN,medium) I agree this opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . There are three reasons why I think so . First , young people spend much time studying and joining clubs . For example , they need to enter the good schools and get a good job in their future . Since I was 10 years old , my parents had told me to study hard to get good grades and go to a good school . My friends parents told so to my friends . So young people always have a lot of things to do , and they also do n't have enough time to talk with their family . In order to get a good life for the future , young people belive that they need to make grate efforts , even though they do n't have enough time to enjoy their daily life . Second , a number of young people is getting less interested their communities . In these days , people tend to talk to their friends through phones , emails , chats and so on , and they are getting less serious about the human relationship . Some of them may have little idea how toIt is one of the social problems . We need to talk to other people directly to solve this problem . Third , young people do n't know how to help their communities . They have no good idea what is the useful way to help their communities . So young people need to try to join their communities once . They will understand how to help their communities when they join them . I explained three points why I agree this statement . In conclusion , young people need more time to join thier communities , to be interested in them and know what they can do for them .
(KOR,medium) I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . In my point of view , I think all company does . I think a lot of people could agree with this statement if they have their own experience of it . Actually , the main goal of advertisements are make huge profit by selling the products . To do this , they should make good image on the product , and the product should appear to a lot of people . If it looks not good in the advertisement , people will not buy it . So , this skill is very important to sell the product to the consumers . Sometimes , people buy something without any information . I think this is because the advertisement already bulit their nice image on people 's mind . I have my own experien to support this . When I was in my country Korea , I saw an advertisement of mini radio from famous company . It looked really cool and useful to me , so I wanted to buy that mini radio . It was brand new and it was much smaller than mine . I always wanted to have small radio that I can bring everywhere . I ordered that mini radio after I watched the advertisement on televison , and when I recieved that I was surprising . It was not that small . It was just ` little ' smaller than regular radio , however in the advertisement that I saw , it looked so small such as my little MP3 player . I disappointed a lot and I gave that to my older brother . After that mistake , I never order the peoduct just by advertisement . Actually , it was not ` mini ' radio . However , this could be require for the company because they need to make money . I can understand their view , however sometimes it makes people disappoint about the products . In conclusion , most advertisements make their peoduct looking better than they really are . So , when we buy something , we should consider about it before make decision .
(TEL,high) It is definitely beneficial to have broad knowlegde of many acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . There are many reasons and examplpes to support this , from history of past centuries to the day today . Having broad knowledge about many subjects leads to a broader scope of developement both for the individual and for the society . It helps to solve certain problems which involve complexities and interrelation of two or more subjects . From the past history we can relate many persons who have been successful in their work because of having a broader knowlege about other subjects . For example , Leonardo Da Vinci was an artist , a philosopher , a scientist , an inventor and a sculptor . Many of the historians believe that his paintings and his sculptures had a great resemblense with the true humans . And they state that this special resemblense came because of his interest in anatomy of the human body . It may be noted that science and arts are two different subjects . Also there was a misconception in the earlier days of development of science that few subjects or propeties were independent , like mathematics and physics ; electricity and magnetism . But they were proved to be wrong . Mathematics was invented for counting and developed for its applications in science . Surely one would not desire to use integration , differenciation and geometry for counting . Even today , the technology is being changed rapidly and many subjects are becoming interrelated . For example , computing and electronics . Thus it is often good to have much knowledge about many academic subjects , rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
(HIN,high) The use of cars today is not restricted to only providing transport . It has now infact become one of the basic requirements of each individual . Therefore , I disagree with the statement and feel that the number of cars is surely to go up in the next two decades . We have a reason for this right in front of us when we see massive infrastucture projects consisting of expressways , freeways , complex over bridge networks , better roads etc. being completed one after the other . There is a conscious surge in the infrastructural development today and this is happening mainly due to a realisation that the number of vehicles is going to show a definite increase in the future . More importantly , economically speaking , going by the rapid population increase in our country combined with the want of owning a car by each individual , we can say that it will be a major factor in alleviating the number of vehicles around . There are several other factors too for example : Individuals nowadays are earning higher and better salaries and enjoying better perks which gives them satisfaction . Therefore they can afford to buy a car not only for themselves but also for their working partners , which is increasing too , and sometimes also their children who wish to drive to their educational institutions on their own . Furthermore , Some people from business families think of owning cars as more of a status symbol and therefore keep several of them even if they are using only a few . Though the increase in the number of cars will also increase problems like high levels of pollution and stress in individuals , it is something that cannot be totally controlled . We can foresee on the basis of the statistics of the past few decades that it is bound to happen because it has been going on the same way for quite sometime .
(JPN,medium) The good way of the group travelling with a tour guide is that the group touring is makes travel funny . We can meet many people who have n't meet yet , and we can also be friends . And if I have tour group we can talk each other about place we went and could discuss about it . Also if I go to truvel with a tour guide she will teach us about good place , good restaurant , and lots of other things . It might be very good things for us . Thats because if that place we travel is unknown country , we do n't know where is here and also we ca n't speak language . When that happen if we have a tour guide , she will set up all thing that we need for us and surely she will presentate place where we travel correctly and truely . The good way of travelling yourself is that you can go to anywhere you want , but if I go to travel with group it might not be true . Example , if I want to go to Dysney Land , but the tour guide said we will go to Univertial Studio so you should follow them . My think is not agree , but not disagree . That means I think you can choose group travelling or yourself travelling in the stuation like if you want travel with many people , you can go with group . When you want travel all around freedom , you can go to travel yourself .
(CHI,medium) The issue that whether successful people need to try the risky thing to make their career success or jus do thing known wellis a complex and sensitive one , which onw people prefer depends one their personal experience family background and emotional concern . Thus it is sensible that different people have different choices . For my personal perspective , I share my idea with those people who choosing successful people always try new things , and the reasons provides below . To begin with , the most important reason to support my view is that new things always means high profit , in another word I mean new things although have much more risk than those things already known well , they can give the people more money and the oppertunities to success . The well-known things ' profits are already known by everyone , so it is hard for people to make large money in these areas , but the unknown areas are much different , they can easily provide large chance to success , Since high risk means high profit ! So after disscus above we can easily knows my view . In addition , there is another significant reason to support my opinion is that threr are lots of successful people in the world have the expeience to try some new risky things . Such as the Bill Gates and some other successful bussinessmen , Gates as shut up his study in the university even the one is a world famous one when he was young and began his career of found Mircosofter Cooperation , this is unimageable in normal people 's mind , but he actuarlly win this game and now become the most successful man in the world . So we can easily see from the Gates ' case that try new risky things can provide opportunity to the people . Although , there are also some advantages in choosing doing something well known by people and some disadvantages in try risky things , the advantages of the risky thing is much obvious . An recent statistic conducted by the Canadian Bureau shows that nearly 87.11 % of people prefer that most successful people in the world have ever try new risky things , there are only 12.89 % of people prefer that successful people always do things their konwn well . So after that , we can easily konw that successful people always try thing new and risky . To sum up , after all things disscussed above , which intertwine to form an organic whole , we can arrive the conclusion that : successful people always try thind new .
(CHI,low) A survery was curried out that weather it is more important for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn facts . There are a large number of people belive that it is more imprtant for student to understand ideas : on thr other hand , only a small amount of people who think that lt is more important for them to learn facts . in my opinion , I tend to stand on the side of majority . First of all , the first reason why I agree with the idear is taht it is important for student to understand what they have learned . For instens , if a student do not understand what he just learned , he could not pass the text in his classes . in the same way , he can not get enough credit and he can not have a good future.a student even do not have the bsic knownlege , how could he learn fats ? Alouthgh , the first reasons i mentioned is a important reason , but it is not the only reason to examplan , the second reason also
(TUR,high) Our education system is always being criticized because of its non-analytic education . For example students learn something without even asking questions about the facts and the ideas of it . They just learn . However , It 's important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts . At first , I will try to summarize the advantages and the essential parts of understanding ideas . Ideas and concepts are the first steps of creation . Giving the ideas of an event or a problem forces the student to think aboout it . As a result , the student not only asks questions about the event , but also takes it further by trying to make an explanation to the cause of the event . This is what is called analytic reflection . For instance , we can talk about the exam in Turkey before graduating from college . We study for 2 years or more without understanding the main ideas . Consequently our future depends on one single test . On the other hand , learning facts is also important but not as important than understanding the essential . If a student is only learning facts , he ca n't get any further than providing simple relations between events or comparing them . He just ca n't figure out why . But a student wh understood the concepts can ask questions , `` Why ? , Who ? , What ? , Where ? '' . He can eventually answer them too . We can see this as an escalade . The ideas help us to get to the top , while the facts help us to see two steps beyond . In conclusion , both systems are important . They help making progresses to the students ' view of aspects . However for me , understanding the ideas and concepts are more important . They provide an analytic reflection .
(KOR,medium) I agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . There are several reasons for saying this . The group tour is not only convineant but also efficent . First of all , I can gain more information about visiting places easlly although I should accept a rule that is made by guide . For example , When I went to Japan alone , I was confused because I could not know that were taking subway or how i can go to hotel . Therefore , provided information by a guide is more convineant for my trip . In addition , group tour is not expenssive than along because a tour guide provides useful information . Also , I can choose reasonable restaurant and shop . saving my money is more efficent for me because I am able to prepare suvinior for my families and friends . Finally , I can make relationship other tourist . It can be useful experience . Whereas , If I went to foreign country , I could stay alone . For example , when I went to France in group tour , I have met a friend who is There are reasons why I choose a group led by a tour guide .
(GER,medium) I do not agree with the statement , that in twenty years fewer cars are in use than there are today . My opinion can be supported by the following facts . First of all the use of cars at high numbers is restricted to the so called `` First '' world meaning mostly europe and the americas . In many areas around the world where we do have a high number of people living , like Africa , India or like in China the use of cars is limited to a small amount of the poulation only . We already can see here first signs pointing in that direction looking at the growing infrastructures in China and India dealing already now the furture expansion in the number of cars . When these countries do further follow the path of modernization we will have in twenty years a much higher number of people being able to purchase and drive a car . And even in the `` First '' world we do observe a trend to a further individualization being seen for example that people move out of cities more in rural areas . And in addition to huge countries like USA or Brasil where people have travel rather long distances to go shopping or to go to a hospital , having a car is even more important . So we have here on the one hand a real need for a car for covering distances and on the other hand the personal wish to be independant and individual by having an own car . Based on the facts desctribed above we will have globally an increase of the number of cars due to the modernization of major parts of the world and due to the individualization of other parts of the world . And both reasons do require cars either for just transportation or for fullfilling personal thinking .
(JPN,high) `` It is better to be specialized in one specific subject , than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . '' Today , the society is made in such a way that it focuses on `` equality '' amongst all . This fact is supported and shown in many parts of the society such as school and sports teams . A school is a place where students are enabled to gain knowledge on whatever subjects needed to live in a society . The problem seen in many schools is that often school requires every student to know the same subjects and does not allow them to specialize in whatever they want to study . That is , most of the schools see value in building broad , various knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one . Yes , it is a fact that maybe broad knowledge about various subjects would help students learn to live smarter in the society , but it also has a great chance of ruining students ' specific abilities or potentials that they originally have . Everyone is different in their own ways , and more importantly , they are good in their own ways . That is , there is not much of a need to know various-but-broad subjects , for they will be provided with shallow knowledge only . Instead , students shold decide to go to whatever field they want to go , and specialize from there . Learning tiny bits of everything would only kill uniqueness and produce sameness among the students . The example and problem of having everyone with the same skill level is shown by Japanese national soccer team . Traditionally , Japanese coaches consist on having his team players have the same exact abilities in every field ; running speed , shooting sense , passings , stamina , etc . The problem with this is that even though the team might not have to worry about anyone lacking specific abilities , it will suffer from not having anyone really good at anything . In soccer there are offensive , middle , and defensive players . But what if everyone had the same exact style of playing ? What good there is to have a goalie who can run as fast as the offensive player ? That is , not just that games will be boring due to the way they play , but they will be unsuccessful as well because they lack players with specialized skills . Strikers score goals because they are skilled in that field , and goalies save shots because that is what they are good at . Therefore , not just soccer players , but students should also learn to be unique and specialize in one field where they can shine . In conclusion , it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects . This opinion was supported by typical school and Japanese national soccer team examples . To summer up , be unique and specialize in your own field !
(GER,medium) The statement that young people would enjoy life more than older poeple is to be questioned critically . In our society , especially in media youth and beauty are regarded as some of the most important values . This perhaps is the reason , why this statement is supported by many people . But reality is not the same that mass media wants to tell us . Today older poeple have allmost the same possibilities as the young people have . They have a lot of experience in life and play important roles in many families , in society or in the economy . The more conservative part of the older generation helps raising the children or dooing the housework . This return to integration will increase , while our economical system will force young people and also parents to work more flexible and longer . Other , less conservative seniors still have important jobs in society , politics and economy and do n't seem to agree to the statement either . The phenomenon of youth as a social vulue was born in our industrialized countries . But the current developement seems to be a change of view on this topic . Today people get much older than they did a houndred years ago . Achievements in medicine and pharmaceutica allow a longer and much more prosperous life for most people . Further threre are less children born to balance the bigger count of older people in our society . The big firms allready realized this developement and defined a new group of customers . They call them `` best agers '' . I geuss the name itself implies our societie 's future view on the older generation and the older people 's on themselves . Today and in future the age of a person will no longer determine what to do or how to feel about one 's life .
(ARA,medium) From my point of view , I see that most of commercials make goods more attractive and better than really are . And I found that from my experince and from what I heared from my relatives and friends . Although advertisements sometimes are necessary , but still there are a lot od deceiving and misleading to custemors . Also for me is wasting time to see , hear and reading advertisements . From my own experience I saw an advertisement in the TV about a medicine that will realive the pain pf feet and it was very attractive , so I call for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed . And I heared a lot of stories from my friends and relatives and the same things happend occationally to them in other stuffs that they bought . I know it is sometimes there are advantiges from commercials , they will expose as to the new and developed technology , materials and a lot of things . But still I there are another ways to know about these things from others sources like depedent research and from the experience of others . I believe commercials wasr my time a lot for a lot of reasons , it takes time from me when viewing prgrams on TV , like news , shows , sports and almost in every thing . And commercails also in radio , newspapaers , magazins and everywhere . All that a real wasting in my time . So I am sure of the fact that advertisments mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is . I realize they are not for me those commercials , it make profits for me , so I do n't agree with the above statement .
(GER,high) I do n't agree with that statement . It 's better to have a specialized knowledge about one subject . I think you can be really good on one or two subjects but if you want to have a very good knowledge for many subject you have lot of work to do and in my opinion it 's just not possible to be perfect in many subjects . There are not many genius in this world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfied when you know very much about one subject . I 'm a specialist in history and german literature but if you want to know something about biology you have to ask someone else . Today there are no `` universal genius '' anymore . Hundrets of years ago there were some guys who knew very much about totally different subjects . But today it 's too complex , to many informations to know - that it 's quiet impossible . I want to study journalism and the student counsellor told me that it | s better to specialize on one subject than just study general communication . Of course it | s very good to have a good knowledge about what \ s going on in this world but the magazines like it when you are a specialist in politic or maybe history . I also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are specialized on one subject . If you are very good in speeches you could become a teacher or a translater . If you are really brilliant in math , physics , geography , history and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improve all your knowledge . This theoretical knowledge is worthless if you are not able to work in the praxis . My mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subjects , especially for me ...
(KOR,medium) It is often said that having broad knowledge in the acdemic subjects is better than having specific knowledge in the specific subjects . Some people might agree with this statement because broad knowledge help people in the diverse field , in particular , they need urgent help . However , I am against of the idea of broadening knowledge in the acdemic subjects instead of specializing in one subject because these day requires specialist in one part and those who have a skillful in one realm also exact well in other field . To begin with , it is n't surprising that many specialists dominate in these day . As one might expect , in present Korea , most of success people are specialist , such as doctor , lawer , and computer engineer . That 's because today ' society gives high value to specialist . For example , people who diligently work without any skill in his field could recieve admit from people in the past . But nowaday , these people are considered to unability . My father just diligently work in his field , but after all he fired from his companies in the IMF depression season in the Korea . All things considered , having diverse knowledge is n't helpful for these day people , especially youth and the younger peoples . In addition , it is commonly observed that specialist in one field can easily obtain other related knowledege from their field . For instance , when I was an elemetary school student , I hated language . Thus , I did n't understand other subjects . As a result , I could try to study hard only Korean subject . By wring and reaing in Korean , I could increase my knowledge about not only Korean , but also other subjects , such as sociology and math . After all , I was interest in all subject , and I could study well in all subjects . In brief , I strongly believe that students should specialize in their meirt field . That ' s because it leads to be a specialist and b
(ARA,low) Young people definitely do not give enough time to their communities . It is true for two main reasons : the growing trend of competion in reaching acceptable social standards and the plenty kinds of ammusement that are available . Since the information age is the new age , education is nomore about being informed rather it is about how being informed and what information is the best or more accurate . That is what is needed to achieve acceptable social standards that everyone wants to reach . So everyone should compete very hard to obtain higher standards . The higher standards the highly ranked in society you are . The problem is when people are trying their bests to reach high standars they spend most of their time studying . the result is they do n't spend much time with their community . When time for studying and hardwork is finished , these people spend their time on lots of ammusements that keeps them away from their community . A video game can make you spend the whole day or at least the whole evening in fro
(GER,medium) In general it is very hard to compare the level of enjoying life between younger and older people . They live in different situations with different problems and challenges . Firstly one has to consider the situations in which the different groups are . Both have an unique profile . The big part of the young people has only few money , because they are going to school or studying at a university , so the possibilities and the offers are different from those who are older and have relatively more money . Young people often enjoy their life by hanging around with friends , doing sports , in short activities that cost only few money , on the other side older people go to work and so they have relatively more money which they can spend by eating in good restaurants , visiting the opera or travelling . By consideration these facts my opinion is that in general no one enjoy their live more . Because the different ressources which are necessary to enjoy your life are balanced . To underline this , one can compare a student with a retired person , the retired person has a lot of time , he can decide what he does everytime , in spite of this he is n't in an better situation than a student that has n't a lot of time for enjoying , the student have to prepare himself for his exams , but this time that he use for studying is no waste of time , probably the student is enjoying his matter , else he should n't have choosen it . On the other side the retired person ca n't fill allwazs all its freetime In conlusion I disagree with the statement , obviously it is balanced , nevertheless everyone should enjoy every second in his life .
(HIN,high) Chancing opon this issue reminds me of a literary character that we are all probably familiar with ; Private Quelch , in the short story ` The man who knew too much ' . A characterer that epitomizes the issue at hand for Private Quelch was an over-knowledgeable army serviceman who found himself in dire situations because of his blatant exhibition of that knowledge . The story potrayed to us what becomes of a man wih too much knowledge but hardly any concept of how to use it . Quelch found that he always dragged himself too deep into unpleasant situations , pompously armed with just his knowledge . It is of no doubt then that I completely agree with the idea that it is vital for us to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely mug facts . Being in the third year of engineering , I have millions of firm reasons to believe that plain bookish knowledge can only get us so far . After that it is the clarity that we have in our concepts and our developed understanding that help us proceed . And when it comes to students , boy , they sure need to have thier fundamentals clear and precise ! A student who just mugs up books , and merely ` vomits out ' all the stored information onto his papers , might do well in a few cases , but when it comes to higher learning , the student will need to adapt to understanding or his knowledge is simply wasted . Questions of application can never be answered by such a student . Learning facts is probably what would be beneficial to students in a general knowledge quiz , but it is defintely not something that should be completely overlooked . After all , what good are concepts when one simply cannot remember the facts they were made to explain ? Can a student ace his exams by just keeping his concepts crystal clear ? Will he not need some facts hidden in the recesses of his brains o refer in different circumstances ? Facts like formulae , values , constants and exceptions . He will most certainly need those facts to help with his everyday studies . Nowadays , even the internet provides students with an unlimited resource of information . It is upto the students then , to properly sift through all that immeasurable amount of knowledge , and extract concepts and maerials that is actually practical for him or her to know . So what a student should not do , is to mechanically rote subjects . He 'll never reach too far if he does only that . He should have an appropriate combination of facts and fundamentals , with ideas and fundamentals taking much higher priority . Trivial facts can mostly be referred from ready-reckoners while others may need to be stored in our brains . Hence , the adage ` Knowledge is Power ' is hardly true . Wisdom of how to apply that knowledge correctly , is probably what power mostly comprises of . We might all end up like Private Quelch otherwise !
(CHI,high) With the development of tourism industry all over the world , more and more people will choose to travel in their leisure time . However , the first problem the tourists will be confronted with is whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel alone . While some people may appreciate the advantage of travelling in a group for its convenience and experieced guide , I tend to choose to travel alone . The benefits of travelling alone are listed as follows : when you travel alone , you can meet new friends during the journey ; also , you can find that travelling is much more flexible than leading by a tour guide ; last , the price is lower when you travel on your own . First in first , when you travel alone , chanced are that you will make new friends during your journey and thus share your experieces and knowledge about the destination , about the world and about the real life . For example , once I travel alone in Beijing , the charming city in China , it so happened that when I was trying to climb up the Great Wall , a stranger lent me his hand and he helped me to finish climbing the wall . After we reached the top , we were already good friends and communicated a lot on our tourist experience . Up till today , he is still my best friend in my life and we keep in touch with each other by mail and share our journey . The next point of travelling alone is its flexibility . Just think , if I was led by a guide , I will be forced to leave or go to a place I do n't like very much and have to go when I really want to stay for more time . While I travel alone , I can figure out my favorite places and to select the nearest routine to the destinations . Whenever I want to stay for a while , I can just enjoy my time . There is no restrictions for me to travel . Last but not the least , I found that travelling alone can be much cheaper than travelling in a group led by a tour guide . As we all know , every travel agency must make profit to support their business . Thus , they may be overcharged on the payment . However , if I travel alone , I can save money for the sake of my own . For example , I can choose the cheapest hotel rather than the expensive one . Also I can choose to travel by train rather by air , which means a lot more expenditure . As the reasons mentiond above , I prefer to travel on my own , not in a group . The opportunities of making new friends , the flexibility of my travelling time and the economic fee I have to pay for my trip are all the factors that contribute to the reason .
(TUR,low) no i don t think its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because knowing a subject very well makes you an expert so you can share your knowledge with people when they need if you have broad knowledge you can easilly confused when someone ask something to you and you can do a lot of mistake when you are talking and it is not good for you in my opinion you have to be a expert in one subject it can be about job or it can be about some academic subject or it can be sports so you can be very important person and also you can make a lot of money by this way you can be famous if you are good at in something populer or important for example if you are good at american history you will be the man that people look for you in everywhere people look for or ask something or newspapers want to make interviews with experts of something on the otherhand if you have broad knowledge for everything you can also talk like experts but nobody cares you in society you can be invisible so all you have to do work hard however its not easiy for a lot of people but as i said you have to work
(ARA,high) Travelling is one of the most interesting beneficial , eye-opening , horizon-widenning hobbies a person couldn have . Every time you travel and see a new place you get the chance to meet new people , be introduced to a new culture , and get acqaunted with new habits and tradtions , not to mention the food . Yet Travelling if not planned properly can end up to be a nightmare . Lets say you have decided to travel to a far-away country where u know no one , and ca n't speak their language , u have never been there , and have no clue on what to expect . In this case its better to arrange your trip through a travel agent where she/he hooks you up with their partner in the country you are going to , to take care of you and arrange some guided group tours for you to go around and see the country . This can be the right choice in many situations . If you are going to a relatively unsafe country , where its not advised to wonder around alone . If you are worried that you wont be able to communicate with the people in that country because of the language . If you are travelling alone with no friends or family , and you want to socialize on your trip , being in group guided tours might be a good chance for you to meet people and have fun while site-seeing . At the same time u gaurantee to get enough information about the sites you visit on your trip , since the tour guide will be briefing you about each and every place you pass by . As much as this sounds safe , entertaining , and informative . I prefer to travel on my own . Something I got used to and enjoy doing . I tend to find travelling on your own more interesting , and forces you in a way or another to mingle with the locals , to get more immersed into that culture , and get a better taste of that place you are visiting . Besides , you would be able to follow your own schedule and go and see places you choose to see and not the tour guide planned for you to see . It would give you the chance to do some research and reading about that place , before and during your trip . You will be you own master , your own guide . Our day to day life is already scheduled and going according to a certain plan , when I go on a holiday or travel , I do that to run away and relax . On my trip , I do n't need to sleep and wake up , eat or shop , according to someone 's esle plan , not my own desire . Otherwise I will end up not enjoying my trip while the tour guide ends up making lots of commission from each and every single shop or resteraunt she/he takes the group to , and most of the time they are bad choices .
(GER,high) Well actually I cannot say wheter I agree or disagree , because it depends on the situation . For example when I want to travel without my friends and my family I would propably choose a groupe led by a tour guide . Because then you are not completely alone and you will see a lot of the country you are travelling to . But on the other side it is sometimes really annoying to be with a group of 20 people . You always have to wait till everybody is back in the bus and so you waste a lot of time waiting for people . And of course you are not as independent as you would be travelling alone . Because the tour guide has his programme to do . For example I have been to England with my mother in June and we did not want to drive by our own and so we decided to travel with a group . But sometimes we really missed to do the things we want to do . Because someday we were in this really nice village but we had just 30minutes there bevore the bus left again , but that was just not enough time to enjoy this . Especially not , when the place you visit after that is absolutly not compareable to this nice village . So normally when I travel with my parents we do not travel with a group , because it is more comfortable . And then my father always prepares very good so that he takes the part of the guide and shows us everything , although this is sometimes more exhausting than travelling in a group . Because my father has a really strict timetable for the things he wants to see and so we have to get up very early and come back to the hotel late in the afternoon . So in my opinion it depends on the situation . Normally I would not choose travelling by a group , but when you travel alone it is the best way . For example I am now in Australia and when my language course finished I also want to travel around , but I do not want to travel by my own , because I think it is comforting to now that you are not alone and will not get lost . So I really cannot say wheter travelling by your own or travelling by group is better , because both kinds of travelling have their advantages and disadvantages .
(SPA,high) I have always been a person that pushes herself to be a better individual . Always looking forward to become a succesful student and profesional . In order to become a succesful person it is important to be brave and being open to new experiences . By doing that , these experinces will help to improve your knowledge and increases your point of view towards life . Being succesful is in fact a very difficult thing to achieve if you are a person that is not willing to take risks . Everything in life is at risk and by saying that just living life is a risk . However , not too many people can take advantage of what life offers you in the long path . I have always thought that when you do n't take risks you do n't go that far away . Probably it is easy to say but really hard to make it possible . Right now , I am in a stage in my life where I am taking the biggest risk . I want to graduate from a graduate school in the United States and become a professional and licenced architect . It is going to be a very big change in my life being away from my family for the first time . It will become the biggest step in my life but the only important thing that is keeping me strong is having my confidence up high always thinking that everything will be fine as long as I work and try my hardest in everything I propose in life . It is the most ambigous feeling in the world , having so much exciment to go but at he same time fear of what will be going to happen after I go . In my opinion that 's the beauty of taking risks . You have to exposed yourself to the world in order to exchange and obtain knwoledge so that you can share it with pride and pleasure to others . The best of all is the feeling that you probably are going to have when you look back and see how brave you were and how stronger you became after taking that risks .
(CHI,medium) Some people hold the opinion that most advertisements tell customers the products much better than they are . Others , however , have nagetive attitude . As far as I am concerned , I would like to vote for the agreement for this statement . The arguments for this point are listed as followed : First and foremost , the enlargement of the quality of some products in the ads is one of lots of reasons for inlustrate the phenominon of the adervertisement did not show the truth . For example , once a couple hang around in a mall , a saler of TV told them the high resolution of that TV is the best quality to enjoy . They bought it by costing more , but finnally they found the good quality only comes from the DVD presented in the mall . So , it is reason why most consumers do not believe what the saler said . There is another factor that deserves some words here . The Ads always show fake feasure of the products . For instance , the picture of the products showed online . Once you buy a good looking stuff online , do not feel so happy at once that you got a great deal to have your favorate thing . You maybe need to wait for the last moment that you recieve the shipped item you bought several days ago . In addition , the gurantee of some produces doe not only want to show the coustomer their items have good lasting quality , but also want adding a attractive thing for asking you buy them . If you finnally make a decision to buy them because of the gurantee policy , you may fall in a trap . From I have discussed above , the enlargement of the quality of products , the more preety but not real picture of the products , and the fake gurantee for the stuff are all the ads showed the products much better than they really are
(GER,high) I disagree with the statement , because I think , that older people enjoy their life more . The problem is the definition of the word enjoy . In my opinion is `` enjoy your life '' not , to do everything I could do in the less time a day spend . Furthermore it is to select the important things , that take you further or let you become more lucky . Young people sleep only less hours and use the time to make party , do a lot of sport or hang around . That 's their definition of enjoy life . The older ones have more experience in their life , because they are older and they also were young . As they were young they tested everything , too . And now , they know what kind of sport , cultural living , meetings they need to be lucky . So they can concentrate themself on the real `` funny side of life '' . I think , that young people not enjoy life more than older ones do . I think , they are looking for the right answer , of what is the best thing I could do with my time . On the other hand , older people normally have more money than younger ones . So they can affort expensive sports , events or other happenings , which younger ones will never seen in that way . And the main points of enjoying life are the family and long grown friendships ! I heard it a lot of times , that parents and grandparents said , that the greatest , the most amazing gift is a child ! And they never want to change the time they had before . And they enjoy spending time with their family or friends . That is an experience , which younger people cannot understand .
(KOR,medium) In these day , advertisements is the one of important marketings in business because it can be the first impression like on a screen of television , for 30 seconds chance can change customers ' needs . I agree that some of advertisements make the product look like the best qulity than real . Primarilly , visual effect is the biggest impact one in society . Televisoin is common media and most valuable marketing for business . When you watch one commercial on television like vaccumer , they show us that stuff works well and look luxury . However when you buy it , mostly time we realize that it does n't work longer as much as we paid and after use several time , it looks cheap . Even we knew that the advertisement will not be the true but we believed our eyes through the screen . This kind of cases , the moment of commercial , it should look the best product that ever made . Secondary , i am interesting in business so if i sell my products , i will make my idea seems like much better than it was existed . I want to make them to use my products like good value not srteet one . If they do n't seem fantastic , they will never try to buy and use . I think that people have bias before they know better . Good looking is good impression . This is the marketing of advertisement . However , we should be careful about that because when we loose clients , deceived them , you never be succeed . Advertisement is giving a chance to ues to customs and show them their quality and value not just selling them and making money . Honesty is the best policy . In conclusion , I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . Advertisements are the creative job and important method for market but we should remember that whenener looks good should be good qualities .
(KOR,medium) There are many opinions between the to have broad knowlege or to specilalize in one part . I think , both of them has a goodside and badside . Inspite of , I 'll choose the to specialize in one specific subject . In this writing I 'll present two opinion with a reliavle reason First of all , It is very important about knowledge about professionl . It can be entered a good company , also save more money than amatuer . Thesedays , develop going to fast , and needed more good surronding , For example , someone need a designer who fixed and decorated there house . If two man wantted this jod , the one man was majored about interior design , and has a good grade and talent , Another man knows about interior design a little . If you , what man choice in this situation ? Maybe almost people choose the first man. so it is important about has a specialized . Moreover , specialized job gave us a great achivement to people . Satisfied is more and more important for the everyone . Many peole wants to enjoy there life . But without satisfiction and achivement person are happy ? No way . I saw the article about `` satisfiction about there life '' on newspaper . The winner is has a proffesional job . such as doctor , baker , designer ets . In this article showed that how important has a professional carrer to people . To sammary , I am strognly believe that , It is better to have a specialize in one specific subject .
(GER,high) I personly believe , that in the modern world it is essential to have specific knowledge . Life in the modern world ins influenced by computers , machinery and complex problems therefore it needs well educated people to solve those problems . For example , nobody is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flue if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs . The same applays to a lawyer . Today the field of law is so complex that it is not possible for one person to have an overlook over all existing statuts or decisions . A lawyer practising in family law typically does not understand the functioning of a company . Therefore if you operate a company or you are planning to do a merger you are trying to find the best possible lawyer available . You need an expert who knows what he is doing and is making sure that you are not in the risk of liablity . You need a lawyer who specified in corporate law , who is an expert in M & A , somebody who knows the court decisions and all statues possibly beeing effected by the merger . Somebody who does not put his whole afford in that one thing ( area of practice ) will not be able to compete with other lawyers in the field and most important , he will not be able to get the best possible solution possible . Of course it is very important that people do have a wide knowledge and that includes for example knowledge of literature and music but that does not mean that he should not be an expert in something . I believe that everybody should take differend classes in college but he should focus on one area . It is essential to know how a computer is operating but you will not call a lawyer or doctor to fix your problems with Microsoft . Since problems will become more specific at the one hand and more people are unemployed on the other side it is neccesary that people specialice in on field , so that they will have a chance on the job market . Not like a century ago people today do not have to be a farmer , construction worker and fisherman at the same time . As stated above I believe that the complex world makes it even more important that people specialize in a specific subject .
(TUR,medium) The people should help their community . But some people do not help their communities , especially young people . Because they belive that they are happy in being this situation . But they are not . They can not see that because they lost theirself in this complicated world . Because of growing very rapidly and basicly in that global world make them careless person . But i firmly agree this statement . This are my following reasons . Firstly , nowadays young people do not give enough time their communities . They suppose that they can live alone with not communicating in this developing world . Actually we can not accuse them completely . Because in this information era when we live they are used to play computer games and surfing in internet . So they became people who do not go theaters and movies and do not participate in social activities . And these conditions help them to alleviate . Moreover , young people do not give enough time their communities because they think that when they could start to walk they are free . And they can do everything what they want . So they neglect their families and their friends . When all young generation did this , the world has became worse place than before . They believe that they are free and they behave how they want . If they continue to do this , this stuation does not progress and it collapses . We must be carefull when growing a child . If only we do like this , we can protect our futures and our children's In conclusion , I firmly believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
(CHI,medium) The education is more and more important to everyone in the world now , but different people have different pointviews on what is more important for the students . Some people think that understand the ideas is more important , but there is also a group of people thinks that it shou n't be like that , learn facts is more important than understanding ideas . I , however , believe that we should pay more attention on learn facts than understand ideas . because the reasons below . The first reason , the most important one , the ideas are coming from the facts and the facts is helping us to understand the idea better . Here is an example , when we take the Physics classes , we always do a lot of labs , for what ? To get the facts , then by these facts , we get the ideas by ourselves , then because we got the ideas by ourself , we understand these ideas much deeper than just learned from the teacher . And also , the facts is helping us to understand the ideas much quicker . As an example , if you want to learn swimming , do you think is it going to be learnning it quickier by just get the idea ? Or you go inside the water , then you learned how to swim ? Of course should be the second way . Then the second reason , ideas sometimes get wrong , but how do you know ? Without the facts , you never know . Like in the past time , there is a idea about if two objects dropped from the same height , then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first . but then a scientist do n't think so , so he did a lab , he went on a tower and dropped two object with different masses at same height , but these two objests hit the group at the same time , so that means the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong . So we see , without the exam by the facts , you never know the idea is right or not . Well , from the reasons above , we can say that , learning facts is important than understand ideas , no facts , no ideas , even we got the idea without the facts , you might get the wrong idea . So I agree with the idea that pay more attention on learn facts .
(HIN,medium) This is an era of technology , of innovation , of invention and above all speed . Twenty years from now there would be a drastic change in the technology scenario . As there has been a tremendous increase in the use cars during the past few decades there would be a change in future too . I agree to the point that there would be decrease in the number of cars in the coming twenty years but not in the number of people driving cars or the reduction in car manufacturing , there would be the decrease in the type of cars driven today , more technology oriented cars would be launched giving a marked competetion to the cars of today . As in earlier times the fuel engines were replaced by better working diesel engines , in a similar way we have the broadest vision to produce more swift , reliable and the more faster models . With such a growth in the modern technology , we are sure to achieve our goal to lesser the cars and increase the technology cars of the future . with these cars in the market we would be able to solve various problems faced now . Though we have very good cars today but we could build a stronger engine or the solar cars or the cars working on cells would be a greater idea in this field , letting the general public drive them at a lesser effective cost . This would also make our environment more cleaner to live and breathe in . This would too ehnance the country 's economy due to lesser consumption of the fuels automatically preserving our oil deposits and the fossil fuels . Thus in the coming years we would have a world of fewer cars of today but more better cars of the future .
(ARA,low) i agree to have to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speciallize in one specific subject becase learining many subjects gives you many succeful carrers and have a better futer while having only one subject you will be bored learing one subject and just have the same subject every day while others can mix up and enjoy having many subjects learining one subject is more easer and you can finish it faster but the bad thing is that you can find a faster job becase there will be others that they will have much highr degrees and they will have much highr rates and faster then the one who studied one subjectstuding many subjects creat many friends any other classes and they can help you in many different ways exampel some student in the biology class will help me in my homework or my project and in other class also im going to have other friends who are going to help me in my homework or presintation but studing with the same class dosent allow you to creat many friends studing many subjects alows you to ask many teachers about many sort of things example if you need a certain and specifc questions you need to ask the teacher who is specific in this subject but if your studing one subject its diffucelt to ask other teacher about a question you want to ask I prefer to study many subject becase im going to creat my own futer and have many freinds from other nationalitys this is my propose in life .
(CHI,high) I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Firstly , I think that to enjoy life has nothing to do with the age . Older people can enjoy life as much as young people do . Sometimes older people even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life more because they are older than the young people and realize what is more precious to the life . For example , when my mother was young , she wanted to earn more money and brought up the child in a big house . She worked hard . She had little time to stay with the children . When she was old , the children all left and went to university in another city or even in another country . She realized that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stayed at home if she had been young again . Obviously nothing is more delightful and memorable than to enjoy yourself with your dear childrens . There are also many examples that the young people regret the days that they would enjoy the life better . Secondly , we have many ways to enjoy the life . The ways are not better or worse . They are not less or more . Young people may want to dance , to sing , to skate or to climb the mountain . Older people prefer reading , watching television or just watching the sunset by the sea . During the different period in our life , we have different ways to enjoy life . Life can be as active as a tiger and life can also be quiet and calm as a small river . We enjoy life in the different period . When we are young , we want to challenge and to take risk . When we are older , we can enjoy the peacefulness and normal happines in the life . In a word , I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . It is not a question of age . In fact , it is a question of attitude . We can enjoy life in any stage of our life as long as we know how to appreciate the beauty of the life and to cherish what we have possessed .
(CHI,low) What is a succussful people ? Usually People will say that he should be famous and do very well in a particular thing . But in my opinion , if you want be a succussful people , you should have brave to try new things and take risks . First of all , if people try new things , it is easier and fast to success . Because in this developed society , competition is the most important problem for companies or schools . We should invent a new techinoli to make differences from others that decreases the competition . Although it has more risks that doing what people know how to do well , several people still want to challege what common people usually ca n't do , It 's easire and fast for them to be successful . Secondly , successful people have brave to challege himself . People wants to increase the vaule of himself , so thet decide to try new things .
(ITA,high) A lot of Greek lyrical poets wrote odes to the beauty of youth , and elogiated it as the highest , most rewarding stage in life . When the time came for them to deal with the old age , all their words assumed negative and dark implications , their rhythm slowed down , their optimism faded away , as if the wonderful joys that they had collected during their youth had completely disappeared , leaving no good memories , no sign at all . In my opinion , this is the best feature of the years that I am living : the great sense of expectation that I feel every day . When you are young , everything seems easy to reach , possible . It is as if you are given all the opportunities you want , and you can even dare to refuse some of them , to pick the ones you prefer . And then , you are still at school . Studying definitely brings along a big amount of new , different and stimulating experiences that hit , strike and confuse the students with fantastic , oniric ideas of what the world could be . This is the period in which they - we - inhalate the greatest part of images , sounds , colors and words , our own heritage for the rest of our life . This is the time when our minds are completely open . On a more pragmatical side , youngsters ' physical constitution allows them to do more activities than the elders can do . Young people can run , dance , play every sport they want without having to worry for their backache or their ostheoporosis . What is more , they can travel , see the world and all the beauty in it . In his novel `` On The Road , '' Joseph Conrad writes that everyone who has the courage to wake up one day and leave to no definite destination is `` crazy , crazy of life . '' I do not think that there is a better way to say why youth is such an amazing , satisfacting and breath-taking period . Maybe , as I said , the most important reason lies in the fact that young people can still dream . And it is when you stop dreaming that your old age begins .
(TEL,medium) The topic issue is that they will be fewer cars to use in next twenty years . This issue is important because in todays time it does show where the world will reach if it continues like this . I agree with the fact that in next twenty years there will be fewer cars on road . Firstly it could be true because of the traffic on road . In today 's world the traffic is so much that we cannot accomodate the number of cars we are having talkless of the number in next twenty years . So i believe in next twenty years there will be fewer cars than today . Secondly could be that people driving get frustated . Many people now-a-days are already complaining about how frustated they are when they are outside on the road . They have to face a lot of stress in order to reach their destination . So i think they will opt out and not buy cars and rather use the public transportation provided for them by the government . So that states that there will be fewer cars in use in next twenty years . Lastly it may be because of the government . The government may ban the use of many cars and put a check on the number of cars being imported or produced in the country because of the noise and air pollution it creates in the environment . So finally the reason brings us to the fact that in next twenty years there will be fewer cars . In conclusion i would want to state that i agree that there will be fewer cars in use in next twenty years because of the several points stated above . Ultimately i want to end by saying that it will be better for all of us if it actually happens . That will improve a lot in a persons life , thats less stress and the impact on the environment will also be reduced too .
(FRE,high) Some people thinks that courses taught in universities are too theoreticals and should be more based on facts instead of general ideas and concepts . I strongry disagee with this opinion for several reasons . The first reason why I think that ideas and concepts are more important for student than simply learning facts is that you can always learn facts by yourself . Actually , you do n't even need to be a student in a classroom to learn them . Indeed , most fact are just data that can be memorized with no or little understanding . But what really matters is the the underlying cause of a fact , even if it is very general . For example , a fact in finance is : `` you should diversify your portfolio in order to lower your risk '' . But what is really important behind this fact is to understand how the risk can be evaluated , and what are the main factors that make diversification an efficient investment strategy . If you do n't understand the concept , you might still be able to learn the facts , but it always will be a limited basic understanding . Secondly , ideas and concepts will eventually help you to understand the facts and therefore are more important . For example , you may be able to memorize the list of all the presidents of the United States , but is n't the idea of creating a democracy in America more important than a list of name ? Students do n't have to become factbooks or encyclopedias but should be able to understand the facts based on the concepts and ideas that they have understood in class . It is a deeper knowledge and probably more general but it is also a key to deal with new situations . In conclusion , the role of a university is to make students become responsible persons able to think by themselves and to give them keys to better learn and understand facts : ideas and concepts .
(HIN,low) I agree young people enjoy life more than older people do . Young people are strong , smarter and they can do work fastly comparing to older people . Young people enjoy life in different ways , they often go to movies , shopping etc . Now-a-days young people are more brilliant , more smarter . Young people when they go to parks or movie they feel enthusiasm . For example , i am a young student i feel more enjoy when i spent with my friends . I often spend most of time with my friends , we went to movies , parks etc . Really i spend most of my time on new year day with my friends really it was enjoyable day for me and i often meet so many friends and i tell new year wishes with them . Young people enjoy life more than older people but young people have to remember one thing you have to give respect , and you have to look them and you should be kind and respectful to them . Finally , young people enjoy in different ways and they have curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things . One disadvantage about young people is that they do some things wrongly beacause thay are teenagers .
(SPA,medium) Nowadays , in our society , we have two important problems that make me agree with the statement given . The first of that problems is the pollution . Human beings are generating a lot of pollution , and one of the most polluting elements is the car . Many experts explain that problems like the climatic change and the problem with the atmosphere is cause by the smokes of cars and factories , specially factories related wtih the production of fuel for the cars . The second problem is that it is thought that energy sources like petrol will disapear in few years becouse of his great demand , so maybe in few years there are not going to be cars because of the fact that they do not have petrol , so they wil not able to work . On the other hand if someone could discover a new energy source , like for example the water , the second problem told before would disapear . Instead of that I believe that in a few years some new invention will be discover , a new transport way will be designed and so the car will be an old fashioned transport . I think that something will be invented for two reasons , the first one is that in the era we live now , the technology is in constant develope so the discovering of a new invention is only a question of time . The second reason is that becouse of the problem of pollution , if we want to preservate our enviroment it is neccesary the discover of a clean and safe tranports . In conclusion , I agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than now , with the help of the technology we will apreciate this in few time .
(ARA,low) on my opinion , I agree with following statment , becose saverel thing . firest , young people nowadays didnt give enough time to helping their communities , satch as , during smumer they do any thing to help pepole speshelly the old pepole , invirement , clean ocen , or drage pepole . so the young must be do some thing to help us . in the thierd world their is allot of station to work in. second , the goverment in third world dont allowd to young pepole make any thing it fred of them . in fact the realty hard to children , womans , and old men , not the young people . so the last thing l went to writte it . it about respenspltey of govrement to allwed for this young to reserve anther pepole with out many . joust for the gad , hapienes , or homens . do some thing for anther pepole will do thing for you in anther pleas and time .
(ARA,low) Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities at all , and this will have very harmful effects on the community in the future . Why are they not giving enough time to helping their communities ? I think because the are busy enjoying their life , having fun , busy in life , Just thinking in them selfs , they are not thinking in others . They will face the results in the future . For example : poor people nobody take care of them , except when we have a problem and you can do nothing you will go to god and ask god to solve your problem and you will make an agreement with god that if your problem was solved , lets say you will give the poor people food , and thats because they do n't think in poor people at all . This is not the big problem . The problem is that in the future thoes povierty that the young generation didnot takecare of will start to act agressively maybe by murders , stealing toward this community and it will be very hard to stop them . I believe that the best way to prevent this is by taking care of these people , who knows they might help the community in someway or other , for example : Mickale jorden , the best basketball player all over the world and he is very famous , this guy when he was young he couldnot efford to join a club , but when he found the care he bacame a star and now all the world knows him . what i mean that we can help these people by persuading people to help the , Why do n't we make a special day in the year that all people an the world in this day will support the by anything , money , food blankets , anything , even used books , anything we might not find it useful for us maybe it will be usefull for them .
(CHI,medium) A lot of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because thay think that they always have a full timetable . I totally disagree with this statement for two reasons . First of all , most young people do not help their communities , because they want to avoid the dirty tesk . For example , there is a park near my house . when I was a child , my friend and I always went to the park to pick up the litters after school . But nowadays most young people thinks that kind of tesk should belong the pedastrian servents . secondly , most young people spend a lot of time playing the computer games and watching television , so they say that thay do not have time . But in the past . when young people did not have such a variety of recreations , the young people usually did a lot of community services . For example , my mother has gone to the hospital near her house to be a volunteer for nearly thirty years . Thus , the excuse that the young people say that they do not have time is just an another excuse of unwilling . Some people may disagree with my pionts , claiming that the young people indeed have other things to pursue , like the job competition , the pressure of school work . However , I still consider that the young people can squeeze a little time to help their communities .
(SPA,medium) Throughtout high school , students learn several different academic subject , ones which some do like or dislike . For a fact , it could be said that most students do not like all the academic classes they must take in high school . However , after graduating for high school , there is a wide opportunity for students to enter a more specific area of study , where they will be able to choose to do something the really like , and not because it is a requirement . Both parts of learning , whether it is broad or specific , are both part of the process or learning . Nevertheless , if I were to comment on whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subjet I 'd say that being specialized in one specific subject is better because you know what you want and like to know , you can do what you want to do , and help others in what you know the best . Being specialized in a specific subject does not come without having the broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but indeed , it is what leads a person into doing what they really want to do . As personal experience , in high school , many students hate either one or more subjects that they rather not take probably because they do n't understand , or just dont like doing it . However , you do get a sense of what every academic subject involves , and you can get an idea of what you like and what not . Knowing that , for example , you like math , you will go to college , to study something involving math , which besides being the area you like , will encourage you to work even seriously because now , it is the only thing you must work for . After going to college , you are already very practiced in the area you like and chose to study for the rest of your life . Parting from there , knowing your area , you can find jods in several different things that involves you area , and for the rest fo your life , do something that you will enjoy doing . Not like in school , where you did n't enjoy passing some class , and you had bad grades in it , it would be like having good grades in a class that you like and understood . A person would just feel better doing something they truly love . Once , you know do what you like to do , comes the important part of specilizing in one specific subjet , the one of helping others in what you know best . Specifically knowing , for example , about children diseases , you could help so many people , who die endlessly because they do not have neither resources or anyone to help them . Having a borad knowledge would also allow you to help , but not as profoundly as you could knowing specifically one subject . Eventhough I believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I believe that we could n't specify in a subject we love without having the knowledge of many subjects . If we would n't know what biology is , how can we dislike it , or how can we know if that is what we like . Like I said in the beggining , both are a part of learning , its just that one choice , perhaps could be described as going further into achieving higher goals .
(ITA,medium) In this essay I will argue my opinion in favour about the statment that says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Nowdays cars become a necessary object that anyone `` must '' to have for difeerent reasons : for example today the majority of mothers has a job and so they use the car to move fastly from a site to another to assist their sons . Beside , the car , in the last years , becomes a status symbol and so anyone would have one of these . I think that the presence of car will decrease in the next year for different reasons : the city are too trafficated , there are not possibility for parking , and having a car is becoming too expensive . Often , people think that to travel in the city is very fast and comfortable to use the car but , nowdays , it is impossible turn in big city , because there is too much traffic and so , I think that people , by the time , will prefer to use public transport . Another reasons is that todays is impossible find a parking to left our car because there are too car and few parking . Beside , if someone wuold have a close box , this become very expensive and very scarce . At the end , having a car is very expensive for cost of gasoil , for the manutention , for the accessories . I think that if pubblic transport became beetter , peol [ pol
(ITA,medium) I 'm in agreement with this statement for three principal reasons . Firstly , the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty years will be much more expehensive than is today . That is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 years and the territories with a lot of oil are instable . In this situation there will be a lot of people who could n't effort the oil and conseguently who wo n't buy the car . Secondly , there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the cities . This phenomen that is has already happened in Europe and America is happening at this period in Africa e Asia . More people will live in the cities e fewer cars in use there will be . That is becouse the people who live in the cities couse traffic or couse public transport facilities have a less percentual of cars respect the people who live in the countryside . And lastly , there is another problem for who has got a car : when you finish to use it you have to park it ! And in the big cities couse parking restrictions or lack of space it 's often difficult to park it . For these three reasons , cost of energy , urbanization and problems of parking I belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
(ITA,medium) No , definitly I do n't agree with this statement . I think in the future it could happen exactly the opposite in the usage of cars , and I 'm going to explain why I 'm sure of this . In my opinion , the main reason among a lot of aspects , is the relavant explosion , in these years and also in the next future , of the asiatic populations , and , as a direct consequence , of the asiatic market in this sector . In these eastern countries , as , for example , China and India , there is a big population that is in costant increasing of their birth , but , what is more important , is growing the level of their social and technological culture and knowledge . It means that those populations , that together have a number of inhabitants which is about thirteen times larger than the one of United States , will create in all economic areas , and so also in car sector , a big market that in the next twenty years could only increase the number of material goods ( as cars , in this case ) which will be exchanged in the global commerce . In this particular example , furthermore , there is another very rilevant aspect which can be affirmed to support my thesis : it is about the relations , in those eastern countries , between the population and the territory where thei live . Although the number of the inhabitants is so high , the extension of the territory that they occupe is very big , and the need of movement from one side to another of the city it is a real aspect we have to considerate . Nowadays this problem is not solved with an important solution , but it is reasonable to think that in the next years , with the increasing of the technological culture and possibilities , will be built more roads and than cars will become the only mean of indipendent trasport and movement .
(TEL,medium) Students are the best study materials for some researchers at various stages in there student life , they are much more interesting to study when it comes for there ability to undertstand something or to do some work given to them , many students go through a particular protocol given by there teachers or there parents at home at the other hand many other students work with there creative brains which makes them much more active and intelligent than the earlier students with particular protocol . Researchers have concluded that people with protocol have less creative brains than that of the others . I agree to the staement given that students understand ideas and concepts more than it is from the learning factors because students interact more with their friends rather than their teachers and it is easier for them when something is put into their minds at the level of friends , for example a kid need to be punished to learn that he or she have to be quite in the class room when a teacher is teaching something , but at the same time he learns to share his toys with his friends when they both have a different kind of toy . Students logical brain work more faster when compared to that of an other student with protocol because one of the student is bound to certain rule to do that thing in a particular way where as the other student need not go in a bounded way , he can opt any way to attain the goal , learning facts have become so boring and routine that students try to avoid such facts which is a great loss for the future of the students . Another good example of self learning is when a student sit in front of computer he or she themselves start exploring that topic or that particular computers buttons . Finally i would say that students need to concentrate more on ideas and concepts they face in there real life and learn lot much of it , present situation is that students who have more creative brain comes upin life much faster than the student with a particular protocol . In future school authoruity need toplan how they mix up learning facts with that of ideas and concepts tomake students much more creative .
(TUR,high) For students to become successful in the future when they graduate from school and pursue their career in different fields , I beleive understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts . The facts related to history and politics tell us what happened in the past and we can use those facts to compare the new situations to those that happened in the in the past . Similarly the scientific facts such as quantum theory helps scientists build up their work based on these facts . However , being able to use ideas and concepts are much more important when we face new situations . Especially in today 's competitive environment , we need to make decisions that will help us become successful in tough business areas . Most of the times our ability to make judgement for a situation comes from our knowledge about different ideas and concepts . Learning these things in school will give us the tools we need to use in the business world when we graduate . The facts wo n't help us much when we face a situation where we need to make a decision . We need to understand what consequences may occur as a result of our decisions and how our decision will affect the future . To be able to understand this we need to be able to have analytical skills so that we have a good decision making process . I believe that this is accomplished only by understanding ideas and concepts . In my home country , the educational system is based mostly on facts not on concepts . We learn the facts with details in colleges but I do not think this prepares young individuals to use their judgements in the business environment where decision making plays an important role . Especially in today 's competitive environment I beleive that making the students ready for business life is much more important than just teaching them the facts .
(ITA,medium) Today the society gives more input and opportunities to every young and older people . The young people have more possibilities for to live a enjoy life , for example they use more fast the computer and the new thecnologies , the have more free time because the school or university , if they are beeing to schedule , are the only problems for the boys . Another points is fot their are the enought of important life question to think ( family , home , tax , job , ect ... ) . Only problem for the young people are the money ! The parties with friends , the trips in everywhere , the discos , the first love , the best friends and the time that you spend wit us , they are example of what the boys enjoy in this time . For the older people should be different , but today the aspect of vision is more different : usually the older people have much free time when they finish the job , so they can live a more enjoy life . Only problem is the health and the money as the young people , that 's not combination ! Infact if the young boys have a disco today , for the older people have a particular disco where is plays old music of 30 or 40 years ago . The most important aspect is the companies that this people have around their . To have a friends ( male or female ) give a possibility of out with him and to go to enjoy ever if the boy is only . The important is not to be only . The age is a relativity aspect that is different each other , a good life is a enjoy life in respect to other . I think that it is possible enjoy to every age if a people want and have a good companies .
(TEL,high) I , agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Young children enjoy their life to a full extant . They dont have any responsibilities on them . They play and have fun with their friends . They dont have any burdens and are usually stress free . They are always with smiling faces and by looking at them any one can be relieved from their tensions . They are always joyful , they try to entertain others through their fun filled plays . They always are very creative and quick at imagining things . They usually pose some questions which parents some times feel in answering . They try to explore new things with things around them with their creative mind . They usually like stories of commics , and stories of tales through which they can know what is good and what is bad . They love watching cartoons because they feel them to be funny , they also learn lot from those cartoons . Some are very much interested in games . They play lot of fun filled games . They can refresh their mind and also do excersice to their brain and body If they are very good at games , they can also participate in national level games and bring honour to their school and family . They can also participate in many cultural events that take place in school or in their neighbour hood . By this they can entertain people . and also entertain themselves . They feel very happy for their small success . But , older people because of their hectic life and too many responsibilities dont have enough time to enjoy to a full extant . They hardly get time during weekends to enjoy with family . They can refresh their mind only in the night after coming from their office by listening to music and by watching television . So , yonger people enjoy life more than older peole , as they have much leisure time and are not usually burdened with too much responsibilities .
(ITA,medium) I 've lived all my life in a scholar system that gave students a broad knowledge of many academic subjects only in elementary and medium school . Then , when students are 13 years old , they have to choose a quite specific area that interest them . So I can believe that this is the best way of learning , and so this system , ho give people a perfect mix of general knoledge , and specific knoledge is very useful for future life and work . In fact , in this set of scholar system , all students have a basic knowledge of every subjects , and then they can choose the most interesting subjects to specialize themselves . When students finish the basic courses , they have to make a first step for their career : choosing their superior school . Superior school are different in their main area of interest . This area make students free to choose the subjects that they prefere , however going on depeening the basic subjects studied in the past schools . This areas are very useful for university , because if you think you will be an architect , you choose a school that have as most importants subjects design , and math . So with the superiors schools , and then with university , knoledge could be specializated in one specific subject . I think that this is the right way to learn , because for having a good career , you need to be very prepared in your own subject , but it is also quite important to show that you have also a general culture of other subjects . In conclusion I think that it 's very important to have a general knowledge about many subjects , that composes the general culture of a person . But I think also that is very important to have a specific knowledge on the subject needed by future work . This is because a deep knowledge is usefull for succeding in a good career and to demonstrate being able to do your own work .
(HIN,low) I think succesful people try new think and take risks is good . if you take lots os think from work when you feel good . because it is very good for knowledge . you achieve lots of think for doing work . for example you wants to write a article for published magazine so , that time you should read lots of paper for knoledge because it is necessary for article . and other example is you risk some think from other field so , you learn about . what is this ? what happen to do this work . that time if you do this work and when the work finished you feel very confident and you will try for other work . I think it is very good for gain something . i dont no whats a reasons but i think it is very helpful of sucsses in life and it is very demanding of lots of field . i think if you take some new thinks in our life so your knowledge will be great . some years ego i wrote i poem for published in the kadambini magazine so , that time it was published . it is my new think because other people always says about this matter , it is very difficult for all person so that tme i was try and result is good my poem was published . My experience of this subject is very positive . agree with that think . it is very good for all the person which try all the time for lots of work and think . it is very good opportunity for student . so i think student should try to do to take a risks from all the subject . i am sure they will sucsess in our life . it is good for study and knowledge .
(SPA,medium) Working and being able to specialize in today 's world is a very big challenge . There are many different opcions and also a lot of people working in the same field , in my opinion is important to decide in which way should we face our carreer , and the advantages of having broad knowledge af many academic subjects and also the advantages of focussing in a secific subject . Having Knowledge of many academic subjects is a hard work , and if I decide to do this , I would like to know deeply the things I 'm studying , not just a simple look , and this could be very difficult and hard . I really admire people who do this and are really good at it . In my profession , I am a Doctor , this is a big challenge , and there are few doctors who really know a lot about everything and are really good at their job . We have to consider that this could take many years of your life , because is not an easy thing to accomplish all that knoeledge . I think that the biggest advantage of this opcion is the dedication , and all you get to know throug the years , but is not an easy opcion and It does not always get the recognition it deserves . Being an scpecialist in one specific subject , in my opinion , is easier , eventhough there are subjects that need a lot of dedication , time and a big effort too . I think is better to work in a more reduce field , to be good at a very specific thing , in something that other people is not focussed , so you will get the chance to work more and in my case , have more pacients . This is a big advantage , and you can study and work hard in this specific subject , learn everything about it , thing that is very difficult when you focuss in too many subjects . Studyng is always a good thing , and when you do things you like is even better . I really enjoyed studying medice and now I enjoy working at the hospital with people . In my particular case , I think is better for me to be specialized in one specific subject in medicine , and I will work hard to be really good about it , I want to do a lot of research about this subject , so I 'm able to know all I can about it .
(ARA,medium) Now a days , the number of cars in use is very large and many people believe that the next twenty years wouldnt be any differnet . I share the same opinoin and think that streets are going to be overcrowded with cars in the next twenty years unless a solution is found . This non-stope increase in the number of cars being used is due to many reason . firstly , car companys are decreasing the car costs signifcantly and making their prducts more attractive to consumers , which encourages people to buy new cars more often and have mutiple cars for each family . This would result in an increas in the number of cars . Secondly , many banks are offering loans to people which help in provideing them with the money needed to buy new cars . Thus , people who do not have cars now adays due to money issues , will have enough money to buy them in the next few yearss . Thirdly , with all the support from the banks and car companies , more cars are going to be in use as the population increases rapidlly . The young generation would find it very easy to afford to have their own private cars and the same would apply for the next coming generation . Morover , the goverment also plays a very important part in this increase . For instance , if a country 's rules state that driving for 16 year-olds is allowed , then the number of people using cars would increase resulting in crowded streets . Also , if the gverment doesnt inforce sale and registertaion taxes on cars then drivers would be encourged to buy extra cars for their families . in adsiton , the cost of car fuel is also significant in restricting the nuber of cars used . in my opinion , the number of cars in use after twenty years would be greated than that used today and if no aproperiate solutions are enforced , then the crowded streets would be another big problem everyone should be envolved in .
(KOR,medium) Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . People who think themselves that they have nothing to do well think themselves have no couarge to try something new . They try only what they have heard and learnd . They do not have any concerns about trying new things . However , people who are success always look for and try new things . These mind helps them to be succeed . By trying new things they get wisdom and knowledge from many experiences . Wisdom is pretty important to live and connect with human beings . Good connections between people are one of method of succeeding . If you do not have any right thoughts to control or manage a situation between other , you may not be succeed . You should sometimes persuade and sometimes control people are the way of success . The wisdom is usually made from many experiences . Usually clever people can succeed . Foolish people never succeed . Trying to learn more and more , even the area is not your major , is the way of being successful . You have to learn and get knowledge . If you are clever and smart , you can do anything you want to do or work . In conclusion , to be successful , you have to get a courage to try and start anything . If you try new things and take new risks , you may get wisdom and knowledge from your expriences for sure . Are you looking for something try new ? You can start study other subjects which is not in your major . It will help you .
(CHI,medium) The teachers teach us alof of different things . They always teach us that to understanding the idea and the concepts of each article is more important than to learn the facts . Even thought we are the students or the teachers . First , understanding to ideas and the concepts is to make sure that you know everything of this story or article . If you do not understand what it talk about , you would never get the the fact of it . My English teacher always says that way to me . If we want to learn the good English , we should read it more than one time to understand the idea . It likes the chacater , setting , plot , and the background . When we can get all of the above , we would understand the ideas and the concepts . Trying to read it more than one time , it would more easy to get what it says in the reading . I always do that way , because I want to get higher marks of every test or quiz . When we do that , we will learn more when we read . Leaning the facts is not really a bad thing to lean . It depends on different people to learn . Everyone also has it 's own way to learn . We wo n't learn or follow the others step . Everyone is different . No one is the same . Learning the facts is another way for learning . Actually , learning the facts is almost at the end of the learning step . If we spread it out , we would know that the first step of reading is to understand the ideas , and then it should be to learn the concepts . After this two steps , it 's to learn the facts . Although there has a lot of different ways to learn , I still would think the most important for the students to understand ideas and the concepts . That 's because that 's the only way that my teachers teach me since I have been studying .
(ARA,low) I agree with this statement . Young people can do what ever they want . The old peole cant judje them becuse they are young . They can go to club , date weman , dancie with everyone , and the youn people cant finguer the life in this age . I think when they coumplete 25 years old mybe he can finguer how it the life hard and how can handdle with it . The old people take every things responsblity and they cannt joke in every thing as young people . The old people love quite place and stay alone sometimes . They just talking about the past and what did they do in them life . But the young people can joke in every things and they can talke with you about what ever you want . But if the young people dont know what you aere talking about they will not join in the counverstation . the old people they talking about every things and they think they knew every things in the life . The young people travel to enjoy in their life and they want to know about the others counteres . The old people feel lazy and hate travel or go any where . If you ask any old person about what was the best age you enjoy your time ? . I think almost of them will answer when they were young and when they did every things in their life . The young people know that when they come old they cant do what they are doing in them age now .
(ITA,high) I absolutely agree with that statement . And I do agree because I think that only by taking some risks in life you can make yourself different from other people . I think this for several reasons . Fist of all , everyone can do the same things well all life long . But just a few can distinguish themselves . For example , many people in life are happy by doing the same things , all days , all years , all life . But for other people this is a limit . Some people in fact ca n't do the same things all life long just because that ' s not in their nature . They feel not satisfied by doing a repetitive life . They must change their position . I believe that succesful people are successful because they ca n't do same things all life long . But not only . I believe that successful people love the challenge . Challenge is in their nature , and they just can not ignore it . They do n't like to feel like other people so they take risks and try new things . They do these things to prove the world that they are better than other people , that they are special persons . Challenge is their life and without challenge theiy are not stimulated and so they feel depressed . So another reason why I believe that successful people take risks is that because they are ambitious . That 's not all . There is something more , I belive . And this is the feelig that a person feels when he reaches an high level , for example in work , or anywhere . For example : a man with a normal job in normal city , in a normal and boring coutry , decides to invest his money in a new activity . The activity works good , and the man feels like he is God in person . He changed his life ! The feeling is the one that says to them : I made it ! . The adrenaline that you feel is such a good feeling . You feel like you could do everything , if you just wanted . So ambitious people also love that adrenaline shock and the feeling that they prove when they made something important . But taking risk is not always an open highway . Tat-s a difficult path to walk on , but if you have got the ability , the intelligence and a little luck it will problably wok . To sum up I think that succesful people love the challenge , love to feel good with themselves and love to say : I made it !
(HIN,high) Enjoyment is an obscure term . It is very relative in its meaning and varies from person to person . But the final denoument of an enjoyment is joy , happiness , a time to forget our worries and to be cheerful and optimistic . So a young guy possibly enjoys more in the company of his girlfriend than he does that at home . Or an old man enjoys more with his grandchildren than in exploring new restaurents and tastes . The reason to write prceeding lines is to construe that the term enjoyment does n't lessens with age but it redefines its meaning with age . And that is why I disagree with what is implied in the issue - enjoying life declines with age . For , most of the people who would be in consensus with this topic , will have a portrait of an old man in their mind , who 's very feeble and is on verge of collapse and for the young the 'll possibly think of a nocturnal creature who never leaves a chance to party . But if we think in a different direction , and imagine that oldies are not always feeble . The great politicians ruling our country , the businessmen , entreprenuers , critics , film directors , novelists and every person who 's having a very promnent place either in corporate world or society , very rarely we find a stint of young in them . Dont these people enjoy their life ? Dont they enjoy their life by giving a complete devotion to their work and benefiting millions of others - including youth . At the end of the day , to make earnest decisions we need to rely on older ones , we need to seek their openion without which our work wont progrss . And dont they enjoy giving their valuable openion to us ? This means that enjoyment cannot be restricted only to regular partygoers and for the ones having a great friend circle . One can derive enjoyment from his work , from his decisions , by spending time in company of those whom we love , by sporting , by entertainment . And any of these terms are not restricted by age . The only thing required is inclination towards doing things from which one derives pleasure . And thus I conclude a negative assertion towards the authors topic .
(HIN,high) I agree with the statement that young people nowadys do not work hard to help their communities . I think they spend their time doing other unimportant and useless things such as playing games and killing time . They also make the community worse in sum cases such as playing loud music in the middle of the night when everybody is trying to have a good night 's sleep . They act agaisnt the society 's interests and add to the noise pollution . There are several reasons that contribute to such behaviour of youngsters . These include peer pressure , stress thorugh family problems , child abuse and so on . Friends may think thst it 's ` cool ' to smoke , drink and do drugs . They think that breaking rules is the way to gain fame and popularity among other members of the same age group . Troubled childhood may add to such behaviour too . Some youngsters may be facing a lot of pressure from family members or through child abuse . This may lead them to remove their frustrations on their communities by troubling them and disturbing them by breaking the rules . They may go terribly out of control and rebel arnd the age of 12-20 years . Youngsters may not be willing to help their communities because they might think that it is boring and montonous to help out their communities . Also to fit in to the ` group ' , their behaviour pattern changes which makes them less co-operative . They try to distract and destroy their community by playing horrible loud music , blowing horn for no particular reason in the middle of the night while having fun with friends . They may throw litter unneccesarily across the area and spoil the environment . They may destroy habitats of certain species and cause them to become extinct . The society can try and bring about a change in todays youngsters through love and guidance . Older people can try and make freinds with the youngsters . This can be done by frequently holding a community meeting . For example , every month a community conference can be held specially for teenagers explainig to them the consequences of not handling their community in a proper way . Drastic action can also be taken such as by complainig to the police should teenagers behave in an ill - mannered way . Parents can treat them strictly for improper behaviour .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I think profit is the most important for almost every company , so when they advertise their products to the customer , the products have to be look nice so that their customer would buy them . In addition , the company should advertise the products nicer and I think this is a part of their job . For example , when vegetables are advertised on the paper , they usually look fresh and clean but not with dirts . Brcause the company thinks they would better to advertise the clean ones so that many customers might want to go to the shop and buy them . However , as most people have already experienced like this situation . When you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy , it seems nice to you . But when you actually see the product at the shop , it is not that nice as you were expected and start to complaining . I think this is natural and what you need to do is SEE BEFORE YOU BUY IT . If company advertise their products as exactly as it looks , not many people would buy them compare to the situation in the statement . Because of these reasons , I agree to the opinion that the most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
(TUR,medium) Nowaday people have a lot of work to do . Children are start with kindergarden then elementar school after that highschool and university , after they graduate they are doind their masters and if they are lucky , they find a job and start to work . After all these things child became a man . I 'm now 18 years old and my all life long I studied and I am really not sure when it is going to finish . I 'm from Turkey and in Turkey life is soo hard , if you want to survive you should work hard . I 'm studing in U.S. right now because I want to live better in future . I belive that after I became 60 I will have money and I will travel the world and my sons will take my place and continue to my job . As I understand old people tell young people to enjoy their life because they think that school is not too hard and there is no illness . Also young people tell the old people to enjoy their life but in a diffrent version . Young people think that old people are just watching television and travel but also old people try to fight with their illness . When you get older life became more difficult because you cant control your body easily and your movements became slower . In my opinion every age has enjoyable part but of course not so much time to do that enjoyable stuff . I know that my parents trying to make my life easier and enjoyable for me and I know that in future I will make them happy and I will make life easy for my parents and for my sons . If every people will do the same thin this world will became a better place for everyone and people can enjoy the life without any age limitatons .
(CHI,high) It is of my opinion that helping communities is quite important for me . With the concerning of the young people may not have enough time to devote themselves to helping their communites , I have several reasons and solutions as the followings First , young people are energetic than the elders , they spend a lot of time in studying as well as playing . They learn all the time and have the will to learn . If they are asked to manage things with their neighbors , they will not refuse and hesitate to do . In this prime time , young people like to help with each other to solve the problem . Next to go would be , the definition of the communities may not simply mean the surroundings they live . It can also be inferred the place they study and work . Young people like to join clubs and learn something new in order to satisfy the thirst toward knowledge . They concentrate with a specific field and lauch their efforts to achieve their ideal goal . All these accomplishments need time and thier endeavor . Moreover , they learn in helping . Such as decorating a club center , recruiting new blood to the club , and even taking care of the sick classmate or neighbor preoccupied with business . However , though they are so active in their community affair , there definitely are blind spots that they probably fail to focus on . For example , young people who live outside may encounter the gap between them and their family . For example , when I was an undergraduate who live far away from family , being not able to go home per week makes some communicational problems with my family members . As a whole , young people do have enough time to helping thier communities . t
(ITA,medium) I think that in twenty years there wo n't be fewer cars than there are today , I think they will be different . People wo n't happily leave the opportunity of having such a confort , they prefer going to the seaside with the whole family without depending from a public service like national railways by having theyr private car that could take them with all the packages directly from the house to the beach with no delays and not trasporting luggages by hands . The car in a century became a everythay thing in the life of the people and only few think they can do everything eeven without that . But the lack of oil will rise in the next decades and the pollution is getting too high to use this resource any longer so it will be necessay to find new energy resources to permit the use of these private transports . Petrol companies like Chevron and governments ' scientits are searching new ways to give power to cars engine , for example using hydrogen or converting sunlight in power , now this kind of energies cost a lot , but in some years they will be the most used way to give power not only to cars . So the cars will have probably different engines in 2030 or ( why not ? ) they will go on rails , but theyr number wo n't change a lot , maybe it will grow if the new resources will be accessible to everybody without making too much pollution .
(JPN,low) I am agree . First , to travel in a group led by a tour guide has grand security . Even if tha travelor know anything about his tour , he can travel . There is no trouble . Second , it 's law price compared with lonely . Many people attennd tha guide tour , so it 's law for each people . Third , it 's fun . He can meat many people during the tour . He can make various friends . Therefore I am agree .
(ITA,high) I believe that someone should be prepared on many aspects and subjects . But not everyone could have the possibility to follow this result and be very skilled on many subjects . Sincerely I like to be prepared on many arguments , I daily read many newspaper and many books about economy , history , science , philosophy , but also thrillers and novels . I have seen many films and visited many places and knew many cultures . Overall for this reason and for my deep preparation on many subject I can recognize that it 's quit impossible to be skilled on each subject . I believe that the specialization on a specific subject is the key to be successful on your own field . Improving everyday the subject of your specialization is absolutely the way to reach many positive results and the way to be the best in your field . For example I have took my degree in Business Administration three years ago and after one year I decided to take a master degree in Finance to be more specialized . And after some months I obtained a Certification as financial analyst , so I think to be more specialized . I believe that is the way to be very very skilled . Studing , learning and improving is the right way to specialize ourselves . For me all that you can learn more than your specialization is called personal culture . All that I read and learn from the life of everyday is culture that can help me in many situations , during my job or also during my free time . Knowing the different culture of the world and our history is a way to look at the future with a different view , to be global and opened to receipt other cultures can help me also in my specialization , because in this way you can change your way of thinking . So , to conclude and to answer the question , if you think to your life as a result or a mix of your deep knowledge and specialization and of a broad knowledge of many subject , you can live very well . It 's important to be always in the middle , the excess in everything is never considered well .
(HIN,medium) Ideas and concepts are building blocks of learning and understanding facts . Merely learning facts is not going to help . If students are stuffed with facts , then what is the difference between a student and a book . Ideas come from interactions which are of different types . The importance of idea and concepts is very much high . The important thing is that facts can be derived if concepts are clear . Facts can easily manipulated and tempered with . In other words facts are not that much reliable . But if students are loaded with correct concept and innovative ideas incorrect facts can be corrected . Facts only talk about a particular situation . They dont deal in general . Again the underlining thing is that facts dont provide the wider picture which a student should look for . Learning fact can sometimes affect the thought process in wrong direction as they may be manipulated . For eg. falling of apple a fact but the idea and concept is gravitational force . Understanding gravitation helped the whole human race . Had this been regarded as a fact only , many things would not hane been possible . The above example explains how merely learning facts will not help students . Innovative ideas are the things that have helped the humankind from the onset . Ideas and concepts are the breeding grounds of facts . If students are armed with ideas and concepts developing facts is not going to pose any problem . What is required is a balanced approach towards this . Students should be taught to generate ideas and concepts and should be encouraged to find facts .
(ITA,medium) In my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subjects . It means to belong general culture that could be used in a day-life time . It means you can speak and keep a conversation on differrent variety of topics with a lot of people , even if some of them are not belonging to your class or to your culture or religion . Even to find a position on the job market is easier because you are not connected to specific competence areas . In example I can mention the profession of the doctor and the dentist 's one . Both have kind of preparation about medical notions and acknowledge of the human anatomy , but the doctor can choose his specialization after the study . Before , he gathered many information about all the subjects of linked to the human body and then he will focus his choice to work in surgery , radiology , gynecology or any other department . Dentist knows from the very beginning what will be work on and their studies are focused on specific subjects regarding the mouth . And they will work as dentist , no other choice . You are tied up to the formation you have received . On other hand , having a specialized knowledge of one subject allows them to be much more professional in shorter time . And probably to reach the goal before the others . But in a world where every company has the need to get different his production , probably they will require a feature of suitability in the mind of their employee . Passing through a department to another one with different tasks requires an elastic mind and could help you to better understand the interconnected problems between the production areas . To conclude I would like to support my opinion with a strange personal example . I am a n average player of many sports : tennis , volleyball , football , swimming and many oter else . I am not a pro in anyone of them but I can continuously choose friends to play with . Never saying , sorry : I ca n't join you because I am not able .
(CHI,medium) I agree with this statement for the following three reasons . First of all , I do think learning the basic ideas of the concepts or the lessons are more important than knowing the facts . Take the math class for example . In most math classes , the students are taught the facts of the theories . And there are some basic ways for them to calculate the math questions . But it is not useful for students to understand the meaning for the question . They always try to momorize the way how to calculate them instead of truly understand the meaning of the questions or the reason they use the way to solve them . It makes students easy to forget the way how they calculate them as long as they do not try to keep them in mind often . It fails to teach students the real meanings of education . Second , if all the students only try to know and remember the facts instead of understanding the concepts and ideas , it is such a pity for students to know the valuable treasure that our ancestors left for us . Take history for example . we did have a lot of famous wars or events in history and they all have their special meanings at that time . Why they were fighting ? What factors made them do this ? and what the results were made after these war or great events ? if the generations such as the students only know the facts that who wins and lost in this war instead of trying to understand the meaning of the history , they will not gain what the ancestors left for us and what they really want us to learn from these experiences . Finally , if the students can learn the ideas and concepts instead of being told the results , they will learn how to think and judge things by themselves . We do not want our students to be the learning machines . It is so sad if students get used to receiving information instead of thinking them and responsing them . if that happens , there is no interaction between the teachers and students . We should discipline our students to think and judge things . They will have their own thoughts if they learn the ideas or concepts , they will have quetions and responses to them . That is the way that we should educate our students . In conclusion , as an old saying `` we should teach students how to fish instead of giving them fish directly . '' Teachers and the educational system should put more emphasis on educating students the basic ideas and concepts .
(CHI,medium) If you have a choice to travel around the country , will you go along by yourself or travel in a group ead by a tour guide ? As for me , I will take the second answer and I believe this the best way to use in the travel , for the following reasons : First and fore most , traveling in a group and accompanied by a tour guide gives me more knowledge and pleasure in my tour . Compare to travelling alone , the tour guide may tell us more background information , stories of the sighting and also introduces many local cultrual matters or traditional habits . These great information certainly enhences my trip and makes me be knowledgalbe to where I have been visited . In addition , it is suah a good way to use my money and time wisely in the tour . Travelling in a group will absolutely save my money and time . For instance , other group members and I share the same bus , we book the hotel with lower price and our schedule is highly planed before we go . Thes significant parts offers me a more economic travel than my travelling alone . Last but not the least , it makes me meeting a lot of new friends in my tour group and my travel is full of fun . It is benificial for travelling together with others rather than by oneself alone simply because I make friend with our group members and share the happiness with them . In a conclusion , travelling in a group and being led by a tour guide is the best way to experience and enjoy my tour .
(SPA,medium) Affortunately I personally have had the opportunity to make this kind of vacations with a tour guide , and I definetly agree . First of all , when you are choosing a place to go on vacation and you have never been there before , the best way to know the place is traveling with a group of persons leadding by a tour guide . He knows exactly where to take you , so that you can know the most interesting places about the city you are visiting , and may be if there is a second time you travel there you know exactly where to go . This of course could not happend if you travel by yourself the first time , unless you have someone you know there . Secondly , most of the tour travels let you a day free or an afternoon free for personal activities , and if you are traveling with a tour guide , is that , he can recommends you places or things to do in that free time depending on your interest , so that you can make even more things . For example if you are traveling with your children you may be would like a place so that both , parents and children , can have fun together , in the case of a young couple may be they prefer going to a casino , and things like that . The tour guide may have the correct plan for you . And finally travelling with a group of people it is a very fun thing to do , because you can get to know a lot of them , it always happens that may be in the group there is the lady that nobody cannot stands because of her behavoir , or may be there is the weird couple with their freek kid . At the end of the trip you can give your phone number or email to everybody so that when returning to your resident place you can keep contact with some of them and also you can tell your experience about how you made new friends during your last vacations .
(TEL,low) I do agree with the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do because there attitiude is totally different from the older people . Young people during there college days they spent in studing and playing games and aslo they prefer to go the pary or an some vocation places to spent their time , the young student like spend most amount of their time friends and others which help them to interact with differnt type of people in order to know more about the differnt things but the older people will think in different way they like to sit in a home and think about differnent things such as house hould things , and many many other related things they feel very stressful life . young people does'nt have a stressfull life they allways think about their carrier related part of the life rather than thinking in different way , they does'nt have the burden of their family that their family have , during thier free time they like to spend most amount of time with friend and with collegemates , they often try to for the tour to the different places , and when a callege camp is there they try to enjoy their life in campus camp and at the same they can gain mor knowledge about different things . for example paticulary when young people try to go for a long tour to some himalayas they often enjoy the time with an real aspect because they like to do more advanture game like skating , climbing the moutains which they enjoy during that period of that time and most often older people do not wish to do like that . so this is one of the real ascpect of the enjoyment which they prefer to do it . the young people will not face more amount of stress because they are more mentally active because they paticipate in the different activity like sports which make them more enjoyable . Young people are more energetic , they totally think in a differnt wave length and they like to spend most of the time in an enjoyable mood .
(KOR,medium) In the present , general young people do not want to participate in their community . I storngly belive that if one helps their community , he certainly has lots of advantages . Helping community brings various beneficts to us . of course , the behavior that support community does n't give vast positive things . however the advantage of helping community can eclipse their disadvanges . Moltly community can give financial aids to the poor effectively and they support for discarding negative aspects of society more fast and useful than individual person trying to decrease the rate of negative aspects of society . Hence if one gives helping to community , obviously he can add power to community and he is able to affect positive things to his socitey effectively . A community provides lots of experience to someone that participate in the community . because a community creates events that help to increase positive quality of society . for example , they support varied aids to minor people . they send community members to minor people for giving the hope of living . so if one is component of the community , he should take in lots of helping events . so he can experience lots of valuable things . Helping the community contains lots of valuable things . therefore it is recommend for young people to give eoungh time to helping their communities
(FRE,medium) Youmg people are said to enjoy life more than old people do . I personaly understand this statement . The fact is that young people start in life with a lot of energy to spend . For most of them , they do not have any family duties yet , and can plan a lot of life projects . At twenty , you imagine you just have the limit you want to give you . You feel you are free . But I personaly prefer another quote : twenty is the age of energy , thirty is the age of serenity , and fourty the age of fulfilment . The fact is that presently , and maybe especially in France , it is not easy to be a twenty year-person . Unemployment is a largely shared fear . The first steps in an independent life are not the easiest ones . For most people , twenty can be considered as the age of doubt . In a famous quote , the french philosopher Cioran said that he would never let someone say that twenty is the best age in life . At 30 , generally speaking , you have started in life : you have a job , and some money to achieve the projects you planned at 20 . As for me , 30 is the age of achievement . Travels are one example . For many years , I wanted to travel abroad , and especially in the US , which is a country I am deeply attracted to . I never could do such a travel before last year . And I have other holidays projects planned in this country for last summer . This kind of things makes me enjoy my life more now than ever . I am 30 . I think that I will have a lot of other projects at 40 and 50 . And I hope I will have the means to achieve them all ! To conclude , I think that at every stage of life , the key success factor is to make plans achievable , and to make everything possible to make it happen . And I do not think that young people , presently , have a lot of opportunities .
(SPA,medium) It 's definetly better to have broad knowledge in as most of subjets as it is possible . There are two main reasons that prove this conclusions . In the first place , general knowledge allows to undersand the world as a whole , were all is conected . It 's important to undersand that any action has influence over other things or persons , and the connections of that influences are only discovered with a broad knowledge . For example , in the business world , to undersand why sales of a product go down , you cant only focus in the price , becouse there may be many other reasons that cause lower sales , for example a macroeconomic enviroment that had changed . In this case , an exhaustive examination of the costs , or a deep analisys of other products prices would be unnecesary , and a waste of time and money . Another benefict of the general knowledge is the adaptation . Broad knowledge prepare us to rapidly adaptate to a changing enviroment . The much knowledge we have in many subjets , the faster a change to adapt to the new situation can be made . That 's becouse understanding the whole an accurate diagnostic can be made , and prepare and serch if necessary the specialist to solve particular problems that appear in the adaptation process . Taking the same example used before , a broad knowledge of the business allow the businessman to notice the change in the environment , and react just in time to adapt the product or the company to the new situation . A specialist maybe would only detect that sales in certain markets are decreasing , and something must be done , but probaly he wo n't have a clue about what to do . Therefore , it 's clear that a correct academic preparation must include as much subjects as possible .
(JPN,medium) In my opinion , I admit that some people like to have broad knowledge than specialized one , but I rather like to have specialized knowledge of one specific subject . The primary reason of this is that people should have good or bad at academic subjects . I think it is waste of time to study dislike subject which they know they will never ever use after the examination or graduation . In my case , I had to study Mathmatics and Science when I was a first year at my highschool , but I hate them and the grade were very bad . Because of this , at the tutorial , my tutor recommended me to quit them and concentrate on other subjects , so I did and the decision was very good for me . I could use all my time for studying essential subjects for my future and I have never regret of my decision ever . On the contrary , I have to admit that there are some good points for lerning , any academic subjects . The biggest one is that we can think of something from various direction . Things sometimes related each other and lies on to various subjects , so broad knowledge could be very useful in some cases . However , I still believe that there are more good points in only one specialized deep knowledge than several shallow knowledge . The next reason for this is that most of the people shoud choose one specific subject sooner or later , so I think it is sooner the better to concentrate on the subject which they really like . In addition , I think it is much easier to remember or learn the things which people are interested in than reluctant to . From the reasons above , I believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
(SPA,high) In the first place I am the kind of person who likes to know about different themes and academic subjects , but I think that is better to concentrate in one specific subject because you are not going to be able to have a deep knowledge in many subjects . I believe that is better to concentrate your knowledge . Some people may think that is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects . This idea could be true but I am sure that less is more . For example if you are studying something realated with the arts like graphic design or filmmaking . In thouse fields of study you have a wide varaiety of subjects to study and learn , but then you have to choose and concentrate in one subject or theme . For example in filmmaking you can choose between different fields of study like Producction Design , Direction of photography , Editing , Screenwriting or Directing . Even if you have a lot of subjects in common then you need to specialize in one subject . For example if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about different themes and subjects like painting , art , literature , lighting . But this does n't mean that you need to have a deep knowledge in all those things . Those things are going to help you to understand about how things work but I believe that you do n't need to be able to handle the lighting for example . Finally I think that life is to short to have broad knowledge in many things . I prefer to concentrate in the things i enjoy and know about them
(SPA,medium) For me , traveling is always good and pleasant . Every time I can , I go to as many places I can afford to go . But if I had to choose , there would be some points to review in order to make a decition . Sometimes or some places are more likely to be visited alone , with your own itinerary . You can eat whenever and wherever you want , you can spend as much time as you want in an attraction and you are entirely free to visit all the places you like . The statements made before may seem a great idea , you are free to decide evertyting ! , but people may exceed the limits of this freedom so the whole trip can result in an unpleasant experience . When things are not appropriately planed , you may spend a lot of time in only one place and at the end you might skeep some important places that you would 've like to visit . When traveling in a group with a tour guide you have the whole trip planned and , for example , if you go to europe alone and you get so excited about the eiffel tower that you spend almost two weeks in Paris , when going with a group the time to stay in such a beautiful city is a week , you have already lost a complete week that could 've been great in italy . That kind of things make the group tours more effective for long trips . Another advantage of taking a tour is that you will be explaind about all the details of the places you visit . When you go alone you may not know for example , that in the mayan pyramid in Chichen-Itza you can draw a snake by walking around it . Personaly , for short trips or trips I do with my boyfriend it 's best to go alone because of the freedom of time I get to have . But if it is a long trip and I want to visit as many places as I can in a short time , a guided tour would deffinitely be the best option .
(ITA,high) I agree with this statement because I believe that who dares wins . I basically think that doing only what we already know can be the starting point of a career but if we limited ourselves to it for our whole life , we cannot achieve success . there are several reasons why I agree with the above statement . Firstly , I think that success is the outcome of creativity . If we see all the most important business men , for example Briatore , we realize that they had to risk and start an activity without thinking about failure . all this obviously starts from an interest , in this case Briatore was interested in Formula 1 , but in my opinion he needed creativity to make an interest become a business . Secondly , success is not a daily goal , on the contrary it is something really difficult to achieve , therefore it needs not only knowledge but even the ability of a person to take risks . as a matter of fact , success is something that probably lasts for only a certain period of time and for this reason , I think that all the successful people are not scared of failure , they are aware of it . the pleasure of success is probably more important than the fear of a failure . Thirdly , successful people have often some difficulties in their private lives , because they do not have enough time to dedicate to their families , to their friends and partners although these are some very important aspects of a person existence . this reason support the opinion that a successful person must have the ability to take risks . as a matter of fact someone that does not want to run any risk , will unlikely manage to achieve success . In conclusion , successful people must have the curiosity to try new things , and the hability to take risks from an economical point of view but , above all , from a personal and private point of view .
(JPN,high) The question of this essay asks for an opinion of whether or not the number of cars will be decreased in twenty years . Many people have been using cars for the last several years and cars are still in use today . My opinion is that although this is true , people will not be using cars as much as they use them today in twenty years . To begin with , one reason that I think there wo n't be many cars used in the future is the connection to environmental problems . The air have been already polluted because of so many cars that have been used , among other pollution problems such as smoke coming from factories . The polluted air could eventually lead to global warming in the next twenty years . Scientists are aware nowdays that the tide of the ocean is rising every year . If people were to use more cars in the near future , this will probably cause an effect on global warming . Scientists will probably try to convince the government to inform nations to decrease their use of cars . Another reason that I think there will be fewer cars in the future is that people are already risking their health by using cars more often that instead of using trains or buses for transportation . Every year , countries , especially in the United States , are suffering from car accidents . Although adults have been have been suffering from drunk driving , ( when they drive their cars when their drunk ) , teenagers have also been having the same problem . The United States especially had been having hundreds of teenagers dying from car accidents when they were drunk . Although the rate of driving cars while drunk are beginning to decline , hopefully the goverment of the US and of other countries will ban the law of drinking and driving . In conclusion , I believe that the use of cars will probably decrease in twenty years because the goverment will try to establish laws due to pollution , health and accident risks . Hopefully the world will improve to be a better place by using less cars .
(HIN,high) I am agree with the statement that advertisements generally give wrong information about their products . If a particular product is launched then genarally companies advertise their product to people so that people buy their product more . An advertisment expalain about a particular product . It should tell about the pro and cone of it . But it can be put into negative use also . Below I will explain for what kind of product genrally companies give false advertisement . In competing market generally the company says better things about a product in it 's advertisement . There might be some competing products , which are already there in the market and a company come up with the same kind of product . The company tries to sell it 's poduct more . So in it 's information they genrally put false information about their product so that their product looks nicer than the rival product . I 'm giveing one example below . You can see this kind of trend more in cosmetic industry . Every hair shampoo is more or less same . They all contain the same amount of chemical in it . But still every company come up with different advantages of their shampoo . They says that thier shampoo is more effective that the other . Sometimes it also happen that company make cheaper product and try to sell them at higher prices . To do this they make false advertisemnt about their product . You can see this kind of advertisements for duplicate products . You can see this when a roaming salesperson come into your home for selling his product . Gennerally they give wrong information about the product and try to sell them at a high price . It also happen that sometimes an advertisement says only good things about a product . They hide away the bad thing . For an example , say someone wants to sell slipping pills . The advertisement says that the sleeping pill is good , it will give you a good night sleep . But that sleeping pill might cause other symptoms also . The advertisement is not going to tell you about that . But you ca n't say all of the advertisements give false information . Some of the advertisement really give helpful information about a product . We should analyze an advertisement only on it 's true values .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because I believe that the people who have strong wish to be successful , are more likely to be successful . My father is a business man who works for the Japanese company . When I was young , my father 's job was to trade oil , and the company asked him to go to NY with family to work there . When I arrived NY with my mother and father , I was surprised because the other business man who worked there were at least 10 years older than my father . I asked my mother why , and she told me that my father is one of a rare case . He always suggests new things and trys new things that the company has never done , so he is working with older people who is working much longer than my father . When I heard of it , I thought it is good to challenge new things rather than only doing what I already know . There is another strong example which I have seen in television about a week ago . I was watching the Japanese TV programme which is about successful people in Japan . On that day , they were showing about one singer who is very popular in Japan now . In the programme , he said that he was actually a business man when he was twenty years old , and suddenly he quit his job to be a singer . He loses his job and had a very hard time until the famous music producer found him , but he said it was a priceless time which was crucial to his life , because he still remembers those times and he even wrote a song about that time . Due to those reasons , I strongly belive that people who try new things and take risks will be successful . Even though they have difficult time before being succeeded , you will learn things from that time for sure , and your success will be even more valuable .
(GER,high) First of all I would like to define what a car might be in 20 years . For me it is possible that cars can fly in twenty years . Thus , the traffic will extend from the ground into the air . The world 's population is increasing every year , which means that there will be more customers , who will need a car . China , for example , is becoming economicly more and more successfull . There will be an increase in the employment rate , which leads to a higher qualified personal and an increase in the individuals income . Basicly , people can afford more , and one of the first thing someone buys when he can afford it , is a car . At hte same time more poeple means more logistics to sustain the basic necissities of life . There will be an increse in public transportation as well . If there will be rescrictions on the total number of vehicles on the planet because of pollution , I simply say that fossil resources will be exhausted in twenty years , anyway , and that engines will run on electricity from sunlight or other clean energy sources . Cars are the cheapest choice for transporting , next to trains of course , but they are much more mobile than trains and therefore more frequently used to transport goods . I guess that the car producing industry will although have a word in that matter , because it is an ever newe inventative section of industry , which provides may working places all over the planet . The car industry can count on governmental aid should it ever come to a point when no more cars are neede , which will never . Ever ! Therefore I totally diagree with the statement , that there will be less cars on the road than there are today . Human society and the world wide trade would crush down without a agil and cheap transportation systam as cars .
(TEL,high) The issue in hand is that , whether the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years . This issue is important because a means of transportation is very crucial in this busy world . The believe that , the use of cars will not reduce in the next twenty years because car is the best way of communication in the present century . I think this opinion of mine is better because travelling from certain distance in car is very comfortable . This is because many people travel in bus as they feel it is more cheaper . But the buses now-a-days are so crowded that it is very difficult for a person to even stand in the bus properly . Their transport becomes very tiring and this is the one best reason I feel cars should increase in number in the near future . Additionally , I feel that travelling in car reaches us to the destination on time . For example , there was one of my friends who would travel in train from his part-time job to his campus . During winter , due to some problem , the trains have been stopped and later resumed their journey after an hour which made him go late to his college where he had to miss his one hour exam . Based on this , i feel that if that person woud have travelled in car , he would have atleast taken a different route which would have made him reach his destination on time . Thirdly , I strongly feel that the price of the cars now-a-days are getting cheaper than they were earlier . This will certainly make most of the people to have a car of their own . Moreover , many people are preferring to travel in car to any place within their country as they feel it is much more safer and convenient for them . So , these are all the reasons that make me feel that my opinion is the right one . In conclusion , I would finally like to say that the number of cars in use will not reduce in twenty years , but rather they would increase in number . I believe this because cars are the most effective way of transport in this present world and it is very much important for every family to own an individual car .
(JPN,medium) In my point of view , I agree with that most advertisings or commercial messeges make products look much better than they really are . There are three reasons of my opinion . First , all of company advertise their product to sell as much as they can , so they try to show their product much better than they really are . They even spend their cost for advertising tremendously , and in these days , many of companies consider how to make the best advertisements or commercial messege and hire some specialists for that . For instance , one of the big companies in country , Toyota usually estimates its cost for advertising approximately 20 ~ 30 % of their budget annualy . I assume that others also spend the budget for that . Second , the companies usually try to make their image better and advertising is the primary stragedy for that . In my country , images of companies , industries , and productions depend on what sort of advertisement and commercial messege they do and how they make the consumers impress about them . In my country , about 10 years ago a small venture company got bankruptsy because of the commercial messege and it was brought to the court . The judge ruled that the image was part of sexial harrassment . I think this is rare example , but that is the advertising . Finally , the advertising companies are also doing their business . in my country , I think it is the same as in the United States , the competition between the advertising companies are also hard and they try to make the best commercial they can . So , their motivation is also very high . In Asia , there is a big competition of commercial messege and they decide the best commercial in every year . In conclusion , I cannot say this is good because we are confused because of the advertisement and we just buy something , even if it is not good . All we should do is just look anything carefully when we buy something .
(HIN,medium) `` { Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well } '' Suceesful people are those who gain fame , prosperity in their lives and they are know for their work globally . I do agree with this statement as people who are sucessful for instance taking an example of the richest man in India , like Reliance Anil Ambani. , has always tried out new things in his buisness , his father was into shares but he expanded his buisness by establishing a buisness in internets , mobile phones , this made him in to a very rich man , and subsequently he is investing his money in oil companies like Cheveron worldwide . Now take another example of another buisness tycoon , say Ratan Tata in India again , he has always been in the steel buisness and I do say he has done good in his carrer but again to compare Relliance is far mor ahead tha Tata . Lets see another example ,, Laxmi Mital had started his carrer with a small company but since he did try out new ways , today he is the world 's richest man . A successful person would like to explore new ideas and work accordingly , this helps him to gain recognization globally . he would like to expand his buisness in various fields and for this if he needs to invest in new projects , he would never hesitate . I believe destiny also plays a major role in a man 's carrer , if for example the man was very well doing in his past years but now he is facing major downfalls , this can be due to his hard luck. , as he is the same man who was once a upon a time a very successful person but now he is no where . If people stop trying new thins and work only on what they have been doing then our nation or say any country would never progress . they would be at one point only , but with risk and challenges we are able to get things which we could never imagine before . Considering another example , even the President of a country comes of with ideas which sometimes are benefical to the nation , and if he didnot the nation would never move ahead . People inorder to progress have to take such challenges in lifes and face inorder to move forward . To conclude I do agree and truly belive that for being a successful person , one needs to try new thing and take risks .
(TEL,high) Touring should be done with a touring guide . Primarily a tour guide is necessary to cover all the places planned ; to keep the time always in tact as it is a most vital factor in all the tours ; communciation skills ; general knowledge about the places of our visit etc . First and foremostly the coverage of all places can only be achieved if guided appropriately . Tours are not planned frequently and if given an option the option should be utilized to the fullest extent . Basic idea of any tour itenary will have the places of visit . Coverage of all the planned places is very necessary for it to become a very sucessful one . Without appropriate guide the coverage cannot be achieved or in better words it is difficult to achieve . Tour guide will know the operational hours of any place . Consider you liked to visit a park , a boat house - everything has operational hours and knowing all the operational hours is very difficult . Though the information can be gathered prior to the tour , all the information thus gathered may not be very true . There might be false informations if the information was obtained from the internet media or a old paper clipping . A tour guide will obviously know about the operational hours , best time to visit and cost of the visit . Second important factor is the place of stay . Choosing an accomodation is the most important aspect of any tour . Accomodation should be cost effective , near to the places in the itenary and the environment should be very good . Choosing an accomodation all by ourselves without a guide may seem plausible but there is no gurantee that the place selected would have all the qualities as enumerated above . The next factor would be communciation skill . Consider you are touring on a place where they speak a foreign language which you have n't come across . Language plays a major role while going to new places as without that it would be an unseeming task of covering all the places in the itenary and reaching the destination in time . Speaking about the time - time is a very important factor . Even if the tour was planned with buffer times it might not be possible to reach a place due to various practical reasons . Tour guide will solve all those problems . Climate and other conditional factors to your favorite destination is important . We may have decided on places based on various sources . May be from our friends , our relatives and from the great Internet and other media . All the information may not be correct about the climate . Say you are going for a fall drive . You will know the place is better in fall . Without any guidance the exact practical scenario cannot be predicted . It has really happened to me . I was once on a trip to `` Vermont '' for the fall scenic drive . Though i knew the colour of trees would be awesome pretty less i knew about the time at which the leaves will shed . Hence always in any tour a touring guide is mandatory . Assistance always make things easier . It will not be a bad idea to grab an option if it is available . I would like to state a personal experience wherein we planned for a big trip to a hill station without a tour guide . There were fifty peple in number and we planned to visit number of places . Because of the lack of a tour guide we managed to visit only fewer places and that too we could n't spend much time in all places . As there were even girls in the trip we chose a better accomodation on the first day and second day we settled with a mean place . First day stay was very expensive as it was too luxurious to stay and second day stay was so mean that people could even barely sleep . Next most worrying and disgusting thing was we could n't get food as we thought . People like various kinds of food and it was a hard time to satisfy all the people . Thus for any tour a touring guide is mandatory . Tour guide as described about will have a vast knowledge of the places we visit and he/she would make the best out of our plan . To really see the value our money tour should be enjoyed with a tour guide .
(SPA,high) This statement is true and false . First of all , when there is a lot of people traveling toguether it may be better to travel with a tour guide , because is difficult for many pepple traveling toguether to maintain an order , and they can get lost , or they may disagree of certain places to go . Traveling with a group can result in many problems and a lot of difficulties during the travel , so the best way to manage that is by having a tour guide . I think in my personal opinion that the best way is to travel alone . The person traveling alone can collect information from internet , magazines or books , and go to that strange country by her | himself , and do the best he | she can to visit the best and most wonderfull places in that country and experience for her | himself . Its true that the tour guide is more experienced in visiting the place you dont know , but people learn better when they have to figure out things by themselfs . For example , when you go to a museum , before you go , if you are alone , you need to investigate about it , and learn about it and things of that nature , so you can confirm that this museum is a good place for you to visit . In the contrary , when someone is in a group led by a tour guide , there are a lot of distractions , because of the quantity of people in the group , and is more difficult to pay attention or to look at pictures for example in a museum , when there is a lot of people following a tour guide . Another important thing is that when you are in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow that group where they go , instead of going where you wish to go , and where your feelings take you . For me being in a vacation is doing whatever you want and whenever you want to do it , so being with a tour guide is like being in a school trip , and you cant do what you wish to do . Tour guides are perfect for school trips or things of that nature , because kids need to follow someone .
(GER,medium) Communities always need help from engaged people . They look for young people to organize a kid 's club or choirs for example . But communities nowadays have trouble finding young engaged people to help them with their work , I agree with this statement . To my mind , some young people are very engaged in community work and are willing to help other people , even today . But in general , I think , young people are more interested in meeting friends , doing sports or work in a job , where they are able to earn extra money . To my mind , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . One reason , why they are not willing to help in a communtity may be , because it is a lot of work , but they usually will not get money for their work . Another reason why young people are not interested in doing community work is because they may seem boring and less exciting to their peers . Young people nowadays have to risk something and have to do fun things to be accepted from their peer group . In my opinion , not only the young people nowadays play an important role in not helping the community , but the communities themselves have to become more interesting for young people . They could make the jobs they have to offer more appealing to young people by honoring their work in front of the whole community with certificates , for example . Another point is , that communities could organize more meetings for young people who help . They could offer trips to those and they could try to engage a lot of friends to do the work together . So , not only young people have to be more engaged , but also do communities have to be more creative in order to get young people 's attention . All in all , I can say that on the one hand , young people have to show more respect towards their community and be willing to help , but on the other hand communities have to make their work attractive to young people .
(ITA,medium) this is a topic that sometimes turned over in my mind and I think that is not so easy give a corret answer also because probably does n't exist a real corret answer . I think that for the students is important understand concepts and ideas but without learn facts they do n't have a complete knowledge . Is sure that if the students know only the facts they are like `` parrots '' so they could only repeat in a mechanic way the informations , but if they undertand the main ideas and concepts they could do an elaboration and express also their opinion about the matter . So I think that understand the main ideas is of paramount importance and learn fact is important but not enough . In other words I think that undertand the gist is really important also if you do n't know very well the particular facts but is not possibly the reverse , the fact without the main ideas are unusefull . I must confess that I did n't used to study a lot in the school , so I was n't sometimes able to remember very well dates and particular facts but with a good knowledge of the concepts I could be safe . The problem is also that many theachers think that the facts are so important and want that the students only repeat like a machine the information . I think also that for them is easier theach facts that try to explain the main ideas but fortunatelly not all the theacher are the same . I always really appreciated the thaechers that do n't try to give only informations but want that the students undertand the concepts and reformulate the ideas with their own opinion . Finally I can say that is incorret say that is most important understand that learn but is sure that without the first one we have an `` robot knowledge '' .
(HIN,high) I strongly agree to the statement that for students ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts . The following essay will illustrate this and explain why it is so . Ideas come from the creativity with in aperson . A person who has the capability to develop an idea of its own can do anything . He/she can produce many facts from the ideas . Ideas acts as the source of many inovations . Thus a person with great idea will never be dependent on facts but will always create things on his/her own . Concepts also play very important role in the process of learning . To work in any field one has to learn the basics of that field . It is a very simple statement but it stands quite good . In any institution a student should invest most of his/her time in learning the basics and the concepts of a particular field . A person with a strong base of knowledge can bring in astonishing chages in his/her field of study . In our histtory if we have seen that great inventions , either by Newton or an unknown scientist , always had a stong backup of in-depth knowledge of the field . If we see the paintings of Leonardo Do Vinci , those are based on the ideas and imaginations which he had and on which he had given remarkable belongings to the world . Although , a small connsideration goes sometime to facts as it helps in strenthening ones ideas which has been developed by using the concepts of the field . But ultimately its your own originality which can bring flying colours . In the end I would conclude that ideas and concepts are more important than the learning the fact . So students should concentrate more on getting the concepts and enhancing thier ideas rather than memorizing the facts .
(CHI,high) Which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a guide ? I think it depands on where you are traveling to . If I will take a trip in a famous city with several wel-known gardens and lots of special products , I will choose a group led by tour guide . It 's convenience to visite the city and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bus and the guide will give many details on the history of the gardens . And the tickets will be cheaper than if i buy them seperately cause those tour guides always have group discount . I might have to buy some products in some perticular tourist stores that the tour guide leeds me into , but I might also get into those stores and get fooled even without a tour guide . Do n't laugh at me as that is the realy experience myself in Hangzhou . I visited Hangzhou 2 months ago all alone . But I took a taxi to Longjing Moutain where the famous villige producted green tea located and bought some tea in high price just like all tourists did in group . As I would did so anyway , why should n't I join a tour group and travel easily there ? If taking trovel to some places like tibet , I will go without a tour guide . The purpose to such places is to experience how is the life of people there . You will not really experience it if you are in a group . The only way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot . To live as you are one of the local people . How can you really know the live there when a tour bus is waiting for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mates are talking about eveything the see around you ? There is no a best way to travel , but planning what knid of travel you are making and then you can choose if you need to be in a group led by a tour guide . You can always travel in a better way .
(SPA,medium) Students have their own way of learning and understanding , but not all have the same way of doing it . Some people think that it is more important to understand the facts . Others may think that undestanding ideas and concepts is a better way of learning ; for me , it is better to undestand ideas and concepts . Many students say that learning facts is muh better because of many reasons . Firstly because you are having more details about a topic , by this they say that you are learning more . Also they say that by having more details , tey are going to have more information in their minds and probably better marks . Finally , they think that they are better , but the question is : Are you really learning all those details ? People only learn it if they really like the topic , otherwise , they learn it for some more knoledge that in the end may be gone . By the other hand , there are students that think that understanding ideas and concepts is much better for undestanding a topic . Commonly it is much easier for them to have the idea of what they have learn . another reason why they use to only undestand the idea and concept is because you probably learn for your hole life , for example things that now may no exist more or history that it is essential important for pesonal knowledge . As a last reason , is that even though you do not have learn all the topic you are certain that you have learn something . For me , it is better to understand the ideas and the concepts because you really learn from it . I think that because of the reasons given in the last paragraphs . Something I always said was : Why are we learning so much facts if in the end we are going to use probably only the 10 % of it ? You tell me .
(FRE,medium) I agree that successful people try news things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , for these reasons ; By trying new things allow you to be curious to know how someone did it and you will find out how to do it too , that way it make you make a research . By trying new things allow you to be positive in your mind and to have a great desire to succed no matter how difficult is the situation . By trying new things you no that you should be openminded , go through disscussion with people who have done the same thing to learn their ways of doing thing , you should meet or have conversation with a lot of these people in other to learn from their experiences . By trying new things you take a big risks , like in `` french we say if you do n't risk you do n't have anything '' , risk in a goog way to takle something . We never know if we might succed or not the only way to do it is to risk . Since we do not loose anything when we risk . ed As for me doing the same thing every day become boring , i can say is a waste of energy and time , To conclude , people who succed try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
(GER,high) Although a good argument can be made that old people enjoy life more than young people do , I think that the contrary is true . There are two reasons why I have this opinion . First , when you are young , you tend to have more money to spend than when you are older or even retired . With the age come the duties and the sorrows . When building a family , there are a lot of things such as a house and the education for the children that cost a lot . Altough it may be true that young people may dispose of relatively less money , they have more to spend . So they give it out for vacations , cars , parties and other things that are fun . They sometimes even buy things that they cannot really afford . Without saying this is better , young people think short-term and therefore enjoy every single day . When I used to work as a trainee when I was 21 years old , I had money but no duties . So I just enjoyed going out with friends every night and spend the whole money . I do not think that I will show the same behavior by the time I get 30 . I will hopefully have saved some money to be able to plan a family . In addition to that , young people want to enjoy now and today . From my point of view , I think it is better to enjoy your life as long as you can . Knowbody knows what tomorrow will be . I heard about a lot of people who were postponing their trips they wanted to take or their cars they wanted to buy , but due to several factors , suddenly it was not possible anymore . Not only is it more fun to do a trip with your friends when you are young , but it is something you have done and will always think back and smile . Therefore , young people travel around more when they are young just because it has more advantages than if you travel when you get older . In conclusion , despite the fact that older people have fun as well , I think that young people enjoy their lives more because they do it with less reasoning and more joy .
(JPN,high) Some people say `` broad knowledge of academic subjects are essential . '' However , I do n't think it 's true . The purpose of attending schools is basically for becoming a professional in one field . Broad knowledge about other fields is not necessary to become an expert . Normally , we learn subjects of various kinds in elementary schools , junior high schools , and high school . However , most of subjects which we learned there are not practical knowledge to live . For example , I studied Biology and Geology for more than 4 years in my junior high school and high school but I have never used this kind of knowledge to solve problems I encounterd . I am sure that it was waste of time because they are useless . I majored in music composition in my college for 6 years . I received BA and MA from the college . However , I am still studying music composition in an another institution because I thought what I studied in my college was only a small part of entire subject . I am sure that It takes a lot of time to become a real professional in one field so I think all student must concentrate on just one field to become a real expert since we do not have so much time . If you learn several subject , especially in college or university , it normally costs more . If you major in two subjects , for example , Fine art and Mathematic , you have to pay normally more tuition than students who major only one subject . In addition , you have to buy more books and materials for several subjects . However , you have less chance to become a real professional on both field because you spent less time compared to students who major in only one subject . It does not make any sence . It 's just waste of money . Broad knowledge is not essential to become an expert . Knowledge in other fields is normally useless . Besides , it takes time to real expert in one field so you do n't have time to learn other subject . Moreover , it 's espensive to study more than one subject .
(CHI,medium) When you read this statement , how do you think , in our life we have lots things need to think about . For that question , my answer is yes , I agree that sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . When everybody get high level , they will try something more harder . because they already know how they can do really well in this level , like in the school , why you going to school ? of course , study , because you want to learn new things , new knowlage what you don not understand right now . Except about education , in the life , you have a lot of things learn too , For example , everyone have different personality , maybe you already know how is this person or how is that person , but on the earth , still has many people we will meet , and you must try something new , to deal with how they will like you ... When I five years old , I started to learn how to play piano , I was working very hard , so when turn in thirteen years old , I got opportulity to went to Beijing music school , but the problem is here : some how If I go to Beijing , I must give up some classes which I am good at it very much , but if I give up this chace , I will very sad , because music school is my dream , I dont want just stay on my level , I want more about music . Finnally I decide to go to Beijing study perfessional music . I was so happy , I play piano better than other same age people and I try new things , big challenge . even give up classes I already good at it !
(TEL,high) Progress we enjoy today can be attributed to some scholars . Those individuals who understood the basic concept and ideas of their respective fields and thrived to develop them . There , however , is an imposing question of which is important for students whether to learn the basic ideas and concepts or mere facts . As a buildings strength is determined by its foundation basic idea and concept are sufficient enough for us to learn the facts . Students should be taught the importance of these basics as much of the facts we know today are drawn by logical reasoning . Many philosopher stress over this idea . Facts which do not provide us with the understanding of how it works are merely of any use . For example , if a student doesnot know how an electrical engine is started and what principle involves in its working but knows the mere fact of its uses there is no point in his learning . Moreover , with the rapid improvement in todays world it is the basic ideas and concepts that are followed rather than facts . For example , Consider System Application Process ( SAP ) which is revised and updated every time so that it keeps it competetors abay . If the programmer knows only facts on which command leads to which result then he wil face problem in the upgraded version but if he knows the concept on which procedure the compliler works then he can also use the upgraded version though with some difficulty in the beginning . Finally , It is through these , ideas and concepts , that the student will , perhaps , draw inferences on how some of the basic things work and work innovative ways rahter than thinking like a stereotype . Thus it is teach the students the concepts and ideas rather than mere facts which is not advisable .
(KOR,low) It may looks like it to many people , but I disagee with this . I think in old days , things that should be done had been visible . It was need to be done with physicall labor . Now , physical labor is less needed by using machines and computers . Young people nowadays just do n't have idea what is really needed . Where their hearts are , where their treasure is . Old days , Society was composed by big families . Everybody is helping everybody . You know who you are helping , because they are their family members , relatives , or everyday neighbors who is even more close to your real relatives . But in modren socity with nuclear families people do n't know really about their neighbors . In this situation , getting help from other people sometimes considered as personal shame for some of us . As society is more and more materialized . We tend to judge other people by what they have , rather than what he/she really is . We should teach our young people about real values . We should open our eyes on emotional and spritual world . So that their values are not to have something more for them selves , but for others . Let ' them have chance .
(GER,high) `` Young people nowadays '' , this is a dangerous expression to start a thesis . It carries a negative tone , a musty `` In my days people knew how to behave ... '' flavour , older than ancient Greece . It is hard not to disagree with anything starting that way . Refering to the statement as such , one has to differenciate . There are a lot of young people engaged in activities dentrimental to society . This certainly should change . And there is never enough time spent in helping the community , most social organisation are working at the very limits of their resources and barely scratching the surface of the problems they try to remedy . But that is true for all age groups . Furthermore social engagement is not considered very `` cool '' by most young people . But there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport groups , boy scouts or Christian ( or any other religion ) youth organisations wo n't work without the time and efforts devoted by teenagers and people in their early twenties . So I think the main problem is to recruit more people into social engagement , regardless of their age . Society has to change it 's attitude towards helping the community to achieve this , not just the young generations . Therefore I do not agree with the statement as stated above .
(TUR,high) I believe that in the future fewer cars will be in use than today . The human population on earth is growing rapidly and this is reflected in every major city of the world . As the metropoles get crowded the quality of life declines in that city . Today among the biggest problems of cities such as Paris , NY , London and Istanbul is the traffic . City officials are offering their citizens to use alternate ways of transportation such as subways but due to the much crowded populations , the chaos of traffic does not seem to end . The Istanbul Mayor once proposed to have restrictions on the number of cars to be out on the streets but it was not considered since it would be interfering with the rights of the citizens . More proposals are being worked on . This problem had a reflection on the automative sector . If we take a look at the recent years , we will see that smaller cars are becoming in-demand more and more . Small cars are seen as , if not permanent , but effective solutions to the parking and traffic problems in the major cities . In twenty years , I would like to believe that this problem will be solved and there will be more alternative ways for every day transportations . Therefore the usage of cars will be less than today . Cars also are said to be a danger to environment . It is proven that fuel gas and motorine are harming the ozone layer therefore endangering the environment . Many car companies are working on projects where alternative engines are produced to halt this . Most powerful brands have either completed projects or ongoing tests to build cars that can work with water , electricity even sun . However nothing is said to replace the usage of fuel financially . It is still the cheapest way on the market that 's why the alternative engine generation will not be as widespread as quickly as the environmentalists hope . However these 2 reasons I stated are strong enough to make me believe the usage of cars will be fewer in the near future .
(TEL,medium) The question says that `` It is more impotant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . I agree with statement because , `` In this computing world students are becoming machinary day by day . They are not getting the ideas and concepts behind the subject . They are simply remembreing the things to produce in the future . But i am sure that this will not improve the student 's knowledge and his skills in future and also the student will not be known how to survive in this world after his education '' . And it is the responsibilty of the parents and teachers to move the students in correct path . They should encourage the student to study in his interested field . And if the student is not listening to the parent , then they should give the clear idea to the student what will be the situation if you do a small mistakeand how it will help you in the future . If possible they should show him the consequenses practically . so that the student can understand what is the situation and where he is standing in this competing world . And more over the students future totally depends on the the ideas and concepts that he has in his mind from his child hood . The students must be cleared with his every doubts which he has . Because when he is cleared with the doubts ( what ever he has in mind ) he can understand the situation very clearly and the parents should give more examples to explain his doubt clearly so that he can move in a correct path . So finally it is more important for the students to undersatnd the ideas and concepts than to learn facts . When the student get the idea and concept for the subject with many examples then he can get the new ideas of the same topic in an efficient way and is very easy to remember also .
(FRE,medium) Advertisement is the best way to realise the existence of some products , but some advertisements allow consumers to appreciate the products , unfotunately it is not all the time proved . First how can i know that something exists if someone does not show me or tell me its existence . Unfornately , the advertisemenrs oblige the consumers to buy and consume sometime what does not really good . For instance two years ago in national television network they made an advertisement about pesticides which were supposed to kille some insects which were destroying crops in the eastern part of our country unfortunately some farmres died Advertisement is good when really they say the thruth about the products ; for instance our factories fabricate good chocolate and it is appreciate by many people ; tourists , students , workers , and other foreigners . Thanks to the thrue advertisement , there is no complain . Finally , a product can never be known by the population if there is no advertisements To avoid what happened to my country , governmeent to take all the necessary precaution to protect consumers and government should encourage population to set up many consumers associations in order to revendicate when it is necessary .
(JPN,medium) Almost all people have some experiences of trip , and there experiences will become great memory of their mind . There are alot of styles of trip . Some people go to trip with a tour guide ; hoewver , I think that going to trip with guide is not best way because people can create own plan , and they have enough time to trip First of all , people can manage the trip plan . It is very imprtant thiing for them because they can create original plan . Moreover , thinking about trip plan become funtastic memory for people . I have a experiene about this situation . when I was a college student , I went to Canada to trip with my friend . It was terrific becuase we could create own trip plan . Moreover , we struggled English , but it was very necessary memory for them . If we had gone to Canada with a tour guide , we could not have taken such a imprtant experience . Secondly , people can go to the everywhere they want because some guides strict . Moreover , most tours which present a tour guide are not free , and people cannnot have enough time to look everywhere . Traveling without a guide are free , and people do not have to concern about time . When I went to Canada with my friends , we could go to everywhere we wanted . Therefore , traveling with a tour guide is not best way for me because there have alot of benefits . People can think about plan which is suite for them , and they can spend enough time to spend only their time . Moreover , the experiences become good memory for them .
(GER,medium) Although there are several advantages of a broad knowledge , I prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area . First of all , I have got the opinion that your chances concerning getting a job are better when you are specialized . If you have studied business , for instance , with a specialization or main topic like chinese language and its global features , you will become more interessting for a range of special companies . You have the advantage to separate you from the mass of other students or applicants . Therefor zour chances are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that has got close connections to China . However , if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subjects and areas , it could become more difficult to find the right job . There are no specific positions in a company that would fit to you . There is of course no doubt , that education is really important and broad knowledge is always be a good basis . But concerning the job market it is probably not enough . Especially today , it is pretty hard and exhausting to find a job in Germany . You have to offer special skills and educations to get the chance of a good job . According to this , people should concentrate on subjects where they can provide necessary skills and which they like to do . Normally , that is only a small and limited area of a subject , in business , for example management and not the whole subject which would also includes financing for example , a completely different area . Concerning the knowledge you are learning or using in private , I think it is an advantage to have broad knowledge and to be educated . In conclusion , I support the point of specializing in a subject to improve your chances getting a job in being more unique .
(CHI,low) There are different way for People traveling . Travel is in a group led by a tour guide is one of ways , which advantage are more convenient and more cheap , people can do not every thing , just follow in the group led by a tourguide , but disadvantage is on free no choice , people can not play and travel which they want . so I am not agree with the following statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I think people traveling for relaxs and make self happy . people work long time want to travel , maybe with friends or boyfriend or girlfriend , I think they want have spaces of self , want have free or choice of self . like me , when in my holiday , I want travel with my boy friend , I want have spaces of us , I want have a remantic traveling , however , if we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide , will has another people in my spaces . I think we will nit happy . And some travelers like traveling by self and travel to alot of place or countries , but some time tour guide don not have the group which the travelers ' want , so will make the traveler spend long time in check in the group for travelling . travelers will mistake good chance and time to the places or country where they most want to go . Hence , from above I statement , travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a good a way , but not best way , sometime people can choice the way according the need and like . thus I think trave is in a group led by tour guide is not best way .
(SPA,high) I do not fully agree with the statement that it is better to have a general knowledge over a specialized one . I believe this matter actually depends on wich stage of his/her career a person is and which his/her ultimate goals in professional life are . For starters , every person who initiates on a field of study should commence by assimilating the simple concepts ; for example , an Engineer , a person who is doing Mechanical Engineering and one who is studying Aeroespace Engineering will both study during the firsts semesters the basic courses of all the engineering carreers ; like : algebra , mathematics and physics . There is no way a Mechanic can design a machine without understanding first the basic rules of physics . But this should not stop here , once the basics are built more detailed work needs to follow to grow on knowledge . On the other hand , to have only people with broad or not specialized knowledge could lead to less development on society , it is crucial for a culture to have individuals with a particular field of study , with focus in specific subjects that can result on efficient solutions to nowadays problems . That is why for example we need to have oncologysts , who are doctors that after completing their basic medicine school went beyond it to study on a deeper way cancer and ways to treat and cure it . Furthermore , if we take this subject again to the college environment , we will see that the concept of having first a broad knowledge to later specialize it is implied on the normal carreer path ; a person starts with a broad degree , lets say for example Industrial Engieneering , then after some good exposure to the work environment and experimenting with his/her preferences , that person will pick a subject for a Masters like Manufacturing , then after more knowledge and practical exposure have been accomplished it is possible to go through a PHD program which is even a more specialized vision of that particular path , in the case of our example Manufacture of Polymers research . In Conlusion , I believe that the goal of every professional is to achieve certain level of mastery or specialization on the very subject that gives passion to his/her life ; but , to acomplish so , it is crucial to acquire basic knowledge first that will provide the foundation for this development .
(TUR,medium) Nowadays , some people think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Technology is growing everyday and also transformation is improving too . This makes people use busses , trains , ships and planes . On the other cars are getting cheaper everyday with technologies improvement so everybody can buy a car today . Today if we look to car prires , we can see that there are cars for everybody 's budget . In my country nearly everybody know how to drive a car and they say that they ca n't live without their cars . They drive to shool , to work and also they are driving for hobby . When you come to Turkey , you can see the families which have three members , have three cars . We can understand that cars have big part in our lifes . I think in twenty years everybody will have car and the traffic problems will be more than today too . Car firms are improving their selves and they are producing more cars than last years . We can see that the firms such as audi and bmw are re-newing their models with new skills every year aproducing new cars although they . According to a article in the Autoshow magazine the smallest firms are producing at least 350 million cars in a year and it shows us that trafic will be more crowded in the future . As a result there will be more cars in use than there are today . In my opinion goverments should build more roads .
(FRE,high) What should one focus on , facts or ideas ? That question remains one of the trickyest issues of pedagogy . Some tend to put forwards facts , others ideas and one 's ability to understand and explain ideas . The problem is not only pedagogical , it is also philosophical . Both of them facts and ideas are pretty useful to one 's education , yet should one deserve more graces than the other ? Facts are necessary to the comprehension of any matter . How could one get the idea of the Roman Empire was without any facts ? Accordingly , knowledge transmission should not leave facts aside for its appreciation a reality . An assertion few historians could contradict . However too many facts tend to be disturbing . The expert who always focuses on the same facts allows himself one single reality . His comprehension of the situation cannot be innovative and his behaviour will remain static . Facts lead to exception . On the other hand , understanding ideas , can help one understand issues he might not be familiar with . Understanding the dynamics of the fall of the Roman Empire can help one explaining another situation . Ideas have a got a plasticity that facts do n't have . But the notion of idea itself remains quite blur . For a philosopher , ideas and concepts are facts . In that letter Heidegger uses this concept whereas in this lectures he did n't . Why ? He asks . That same professor while having spent too much time in the pool of ideas has made it a tank full of facts . One has to be cautious with ideas as well . Moreover , ideas tend to lead us to abstraction . Even though abstraction is attractive , it can end up on dramatic mistakes . The commitment of several French intellectuals along with communism testifies of it . Students should therefore be as keen on facts as they should be on ideas . One does not prevail on the other . They should be intertwined .
(CHI,medium) Nowadays , more and more surveys show what most parents and teachers want their children and students to do is understanding the ideas and concepts of a tapic . However , it is important ability and will help children to get a high mark in a test , I believe it is more important for students to learn facts . It is good for a student future . They need not only the ability how to get a high mark , but also they need to learn how to see clearly a fact . In today society , there are plenty of competing . Students need to learn these facts and change themself to suit this society . Moreover , students can learn what they realy need from thoes facts . Facts not only teach students what the things look like or what happened , it show some result . For instance , an accident , this fact contains when where what and why . It means if you have drink before you drive , you will have an accident . Maybe not just go to hospital , you will dy . It seems that facts can save a person 's life . To understand ideas and concepts , is important . It also help students to larn facts . They have a strong relationship and both are improtant , but we need to find a balance . students who have strong ability of understanding ideas and concepts can easy to get the facts . They will concentrate more information and quickly put them together . Then , they maybe put it in a real deep thinking , and they will get more philosophy from it . Consequently , understanding ideas and concepts help students to learn facts . In conclusion , learning facts help students a lot in the future as the students can easily get in society , and find the position which most suit for them , Facts also can save students ' life in some dagerous situation , and the students who have a good understanging ideas and concepts , will easy to get the information of the facts . There are many disadvantages and advantages about learn facts is important than understanding , but I believe advatages is more important .
(CHI,medium) Based on my current observation and personal experiece , I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . First of all , young people nowadays are too occupied by class work . Take myself for example , when I was young school did not demand so much class work as they do today . My younger brother who goes to college now spend almost all of his weekend working on class projectes . He barely has anytime to do anything that he is interested in . While in the past , my college was not so demanding and I had much more free time to engage in cummunity activities . Secondly , due to the advent of the internet and mobile phone , young people nowadays have very few connections with the communities . Young people nowadays spend most of their time in their rooms surfing the internet or talking to their friends through the mobile phone . They seldom go out and meet people in the communities , not to mention offering any help to the communities . Recently , I had a chance to visit a children hospital that I used to volunteered when I was in college . I was surprized by the few number of college students now volunteering there . Finally , I find an obvious trend from recent newspapers and magzines ; the number of hosipital and non-profit organizaion lacking volunteer is increasing . Especially , those activities that were traditionally carried out by young people . For example , the Taiwanese government started a program some years ago to recruit young people to offer volunteer work overseas . Recently , I read an article on the newspaper saying that now the government is having difficulties getting enough young people to help the communities . Based on the three specific experiences and observation I decribed above , I agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not help their communities enough .
(KOR,medium) I am agree with the statement saying , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than it is today . '' The use of cars is in the increasing stage during these days . However , I believe that this condition will completely change during next twenty years . First reason of reduce in use of car will be pollution of the environment . Car is the main cause of pollution of the earth every year . This fact was most likely ignored by the people during past few years . However , people start to recognize the importance of maintaining good environment condition and try to do their best for it . Other reason that cars will be less used in the future is the globalization . Globalization means that the world is not separating as an individual but conforming as one big community . Therefore , other transportation , which is airplane or ship , to travel oversea will be more used than the car . Car will be just used for the travel within the land or continent . In fact , people even start to use transportaion such as subway or airplane more than the car . The final reason that effects the use of the cars is the development of the technology . I personally believe that the development of the technology will soon invent or create new way of transportaion . This new way of transportaion will be much faster than the car and have less harm on the environment . This will make the cars to be not welcomed by the human society anymore . The changes in the world occurs much faster than the past . In other words , there can be big change in a very short period of time . Therefore , twenty years are definitely not a short time for cars to be in a less use .
(JPN,low) I agree on this statement . I think people loose stenght and other physical ability as they get older and also they loose free time to have fun . Young people can enjoy there time without any matter of money or time . I think that older people does not have time to enjoy life . What they have in mind is the reponsibility of there family and the worry of of children , so they need to work work and work for their family . If they stoped working no one will help your family nor your self . This belief is a common sence to teenager . We all believe that people working does not have the extra stenght to entertain their self . On the contrary , teenager have both the srenght and time . We use our time luxurious as it seems eternal . We do not have to think of responsibility . Therefore what we do in our dily life is to have fun everiday any minute , and do not think about the future . We use our time only to entertain our selves . Teenagers are free to do any thing . Most of the teenager in Japan think to enjoy life . Young people still have not seen the hardness of life because they still do not have the responsibility . but I think that is not bad . Young people can use that time freely to get mature . The young age is filled with experiences and their experiences makes their life so enjoyabl
(KOR,medium) Some university teach the student with broad knowledge of many academic subjects and others concentrate on specific subject . In my opinon , if I can choose , I would rather study one specific subject . Fisrt , I can study deeper in same amont of time . If I have more knowlege in one subject I can use it more . Also I think if I had the experience study deep enough in one subject , studying other sbuject is much easier than before . However , if I never had that experience I can only go as far as the first subject with the second subject or hard to study deeper because I do not have experience . Second , these days , the company wants the people who has a great knowledge about one specific subject . In our socity we work togeather . Most of the company has parts of the work and expected them to do their own job not the other persons job . If each of the employees can finish their job perfectly there will be no problem of the soving the task . Last , you can share the information about what you know well . If there is an issue that need to discuss about your major , you can explain to other people because you know it well . However you know it vaguelly the information that you would explain would not helpfull , in worst situation that could give more confusion to the people who are listening to your explanation . As I talk about the advantages of leaning a specific subject , I support the idea . I want to have one specific knowledge and I think it helps me and the socity at the same time .
(FRE,low) In my point of view , young people enjoy more life than old because they have less experience in the life . I agree that young people have more fun because they have no or less problems than this older . Besides they have less responsabilities . For example someome who has a child have a lot of responsibilities , he does not give a bad image of him to his child . Sometimes , they have maybe sometimes problem of money in to pay tax or something like that and this braek the envoy life . Moreover , i think old people have alerady live a good time when they were young . For them , i think it ' more difficult to find another way in order to have fun because they have already do this . Young people have more fun because they need it and in the most part of time they are lonely , they can make what they want to do without to be judge by anyone . For example in the street you can ware what you like and got the color of hair like you want . Howerver , older people have more time in order to envoy life , in the most of cases they have finish to work and have enough money to do theirs hobbies . In the other side , i think when we have a passion in your life you can enjoy your life like no other as if you are more older . For example , a older who like sport can enjoy his life because they do what he likes . As a result , i think enjoy your life no depend of your age but only of the situation and the problem or responsabilitie and then i think it is so a question of passion .
(HIN,high) Nowadays , the world is moving at such a fast pace that it would be very difficult for me to agree or disagree on whether cars can become fewer , since I ca n't predict what kind of turn the future can take . So many technologies and various inventions are taking place that it is definately possible for the cars to be fewer in another twenty years . Cars have become such a necessity in our daily lives that , I feel that cars could probably never cease to be fewer as life goes on . Cars have brought such a big impact on our lives that it would be impossible to think of a life without cars and basic transportation . Cars are our way of life - a necessity , which we on any given circumstance ca n't live without . Our life , thesedays , revolves around going from one place to another , transporting goods and other facilities and other various activities connected with transportation . To think that twenty years from now there could be fewer cars on our roads , than there are today is not impossible , it is definately a possibility as the world is progressing and coming up with so much newer and varied forms of technologies and ideas . It would definately be a big misinterpretation of the fact - that the world is n't moving on , if I would say that cars cannot be replaced by something much more sophisticated and efficient for our daily lives . In today 's world , nothing is impossible . There is always a possibility for the human mind to come up with anything impossible . So coming up with a replacement mode of transportation would n't be too diffcult . Therefore , I would say , that maybe not twenty years from now , but definately somewhere in the future there will be a good and efficient replacement for our cars , thus resulting in fewer cars on our roads .
(HIN,medium) Younger people enjoys life more than the older people do . I will go with this , although it is said that one should be younger at heart rather than by your age . Another saying says that you should be younger at heart to enjoy the life to the fullest . Young people are always envied by the olders that they are having more fun . It is true since younger people has all the time , enthusiasm as well as the energy to enjoy the life till maximum . The younger generation involves themselves into lot of extra-curricular activities . The younger generation have all the time for all the enjoyments . After their studies they do not have great responsibilities to take care of . Thus they are free to do all the stuff what they want . The younger lot has got all the companions in the form of friends to enjoy the time they are having . Enjoying or having fun becomes more when you are having a friend . Moreover the younger people are a lot energetic to carry out the adventurous stufs of camping or touring . While youger lot are able to get away with anythiny they do . They are not responsible to any of the action or to say they are not bothered what others have to say . As the person grows older he is bond into varuious social rituals . He is now married and having family . The life of a older person is distributed into various phases like private life , family life , professional life etc . Now the man is carrying various family , professional and social responsiblities . After all these things he is left with a very limited time or resources to enjoy the life . Although its much needed to say here that they meaning of enjoyment changes here . But keeping the fact that younger people enjoys the life more , it should be taken care that they do not run on to the rough patches . The younger lot is very much vulnerable to get spoilt , so its becomes duty of the younger people that they should \ take care of these things and thsy also should be the part of the enjoyment along with the younger generation .
(SPA,high) Nowadays , people are trying to succeed in life in various ways . They do this by learning new things , adquiring advanced technology , reading , updating themselves with whats going on in the world , and coming up with strategically ideas in which they can use these not only in the business , but personally . I agree with this statement because if people did n't take any risks we would still be far behind technology , knowledge , etc . The problem is , many people do n't like to take risks because they do n't want to lose time in trying out new things , they usually stick to what they 're good at , at that point . Another problem is that many of us are afraid to fail and just do n't want to regret the time we spent , money , our sacrifice . Most people just sit around and live up to other people expectations . In the other hand , I understand the fear people have in taking risks because at the end , it all comes down to one question : is it going to be worth it ? Well , you may not have an answer right away but as i said , if we do n't take risks at any chance , we will just be sitting around , waiting , and doing the same thing over and over again . Going back through history , if mechanical people , engineers , architects , would n't have taken risks in manufacturing some kind of transportation for the world , we would probably still be walikng through one place to another . The great discoveries that have occured took place because of the people who took a risk back then and we are what we are because of those people . For example , microscope , telefone , medicine , transportation , internet . In conclusion , we should all take risks at some point of our lives . We could make dramatic changes in life by helping ourselves , others and the world by contributing and passing on our knowledge and courage .
(TUR,medium) I disagree with the `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' statement . Although the form , shape of cars will always change with the choices and likes of people the concept of cars will always be there and the number of cars on the streets will increase until a restricting law passed on that . People have some everlasting relations with some objects that they will never give up no matter what . And car is that type of an object . People got used to driving car , this is a pleasure for them and a different color in life . Think of a telephone for instance we have internet and we have VOIP ( Voice over IP ) technology which enables us to speak on internet without any cost and with anybody all over the world , did it cause in less number of phones at homes ? or did it reduce the number of celluler phone sales ? I dont think so because people got used to speaking on the phone and this wont change at least this wont change in twenty years of time and people will go on talking on the phone just like driving their cars back home . There might be other transportation alternatives and they might be cheaper too in twenty years of time but that wont change the car sales , actually it might even increase because population of the world will increase . In conclusion we can think driving car as a all the time activity , it will not get fewer but increase .
(TEL,high) The issue at hand is that the youngsters of the present age do n't devote enough time for helping their communities . This issue is of significant importance because it questions our ability to carry forward our ancient traditions to the younger generations . I personally agree with the above argument . There are many reasons for which i agree to the statement . First , the youngsters nowadays hardly get time to spend in helping their communities . This is mainly because they are most of the time involved in academics or even over burdened by them . They have hardly any time to help their communities , let alone relax . They are overburdened with assignments and tests in their courses most of the time . Being an undergraduate , i hardly find any time for other activities due to my busy academic schedule . Secondly , the youngsters today are less inclined towards the propogation of their community culture . This is mainly because of the various factors , the main reason being the lack of interest on part of the parents . It is the parents ' duty to instill the feeling of belongingness towards their own community and culture . This can be attributed to the fact that the parents are also occupied with their works and hardly find time to spend with their children . The parents should also encourage children to participate in cultural events . However , the parents rarely show interest in such issues . Another reason for this could be that the interactions and regular meetings between communities have declined gradually . This can be attributed to the increased amount of migration of people to distant urban places in search of greener pastures . The long distance also provides hindrance to the regular meetings of the communities . After my family migrated to the city , we could not find time to regularly meet our relatives since the city was far away from our village . In conclusion , i feel that all the above factors have eventually led to the lack of time for the youngsters in helping their communities
(TUR,low) I am a young person and I agree with this statement . I thing we do not give enough time to helping our communities . In fact we do not give enough time a lot of things . For example we do not read enough or we do not go to cinema and theatre enough . We spent huge times for internet chat and computer games ... etc . And I thing chat and computer games are very unnecessary things . But unfortunately chat and computer games have commoned very easy and fastly . I thing we correct this situation shortly times . If we do not correct this situation our young people will give up helping their communities . For example Using the telephone has decreased since the internet commonly . Young people chat with they do not know everyone . And they do not know that they are lier . Also young people do not give enough time our friends . We choose play computer games or chat . So our friends is decrease . Finally I think we are giving enough time to helping our communities .
(FRE,medium) There are different types of travelers , those who like traveling in group led by a tour guide and the others , more courageous , who like traveling alone . I my opinion , traveling in a group far outweights traveling alone . There are two main reasons why I strongly agree with this statement : you travel peacefully and you do n't have to worry about where you will arrive . Travelling is a great experience but sometimes it can be a little bit scary . That why I prefer to travel in a group , indeed you can leave your home more peacefully and enjoy more your trip . Furthermore you do n't have to worry about nothing because everything is organized by the tour guide . The other reason why I certainly prefer to travel in a group is because of the tour guide . In a the matter of fact I can be sure that he will already knows the places to visit and for sure the places to avoid . Consequently I will not have any bad surprises or bad experiences with the native people met in the new country . In addition the guide tour can explains clearly the culture , the importance of the monuments and the history of the unknown country . In conclusion traveling in a group permits me to avoid the stress due to the trip and to learn more about the country I visit . it is for thess reason i strongly recommend everyon
(GER,medium) There are lots of factors which would influence that statement but I think that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today . On the one hand , oil prices are getting higher and higher because the resources of petroleum are very limited and so the car as we know it today will be too expensive to afford in twenty years . The problem is that the resources are limited and getting more and more difficult to reach . We need to dig for oil in regions no ones ever lived before for example in Alaska or on the ground of the ocean . The other thing is that the pollution by cars is very dangerous for our environement , the ozone layer is getting thinner , we have global warming and for a big part of this the pollution by cars is responsible . This has to stop . On the other hand there is a scientific progress on running cars on water or hybrid cars which need less gas than the old fashioned cars . They use the energy wasted at breaking to load a battery . So maybe we do not need any more or much less oil in the future to run a car . The pollution by cars would decrease too . If they were running on water the only pollution would be water which is not dangerous at all . We also do not have any real replacing public transportation system at the moment and probably will not have in the near future . The busses and trains are a possible alternative in the big cities but in the rural areas there is no such thing like trains running every ten minutes , one has to wait approximatly two hours or more to get a train or bus and the busses are traveling much slower than the cars . In a time where time is money , most of the people need to get as fast as possible from one point to another . So as the population of mankind increases steadily there will be more cars in the future , hopefully cleaner and more secure ones .
(ITA,low) which kind of cars we will use ? todaty cars are considerate like a status symbol of the last century , so I agree that in twenty years we will be full of car than today . In my opinion the car will cost less than today , so every family will have a car each person .
(KOR,medium) Todays , many students are forcing to perform a lot of role . They have to both study hard and help community . But they have enough time to perform various role . It can be explain to two reason . I will explain it in detail . First , Although , they want to participate in community like activity helping orphanage or the poor , their parents does n't like it . They think that their children have to study more for surviving competition . they give a good circumstance to study for their children . and They always saids that studying is most important . For this reason , student study harder in their school and their academic institutions . Let me take my friends as an example . His initial dream was a counselor for poor person . He interested in books and class such as counselling for community . But their parents disagreed his idea . They always argued because of this problem . After all , he had to give up his dream . And he made up decision teacher their parents want . Secondly , the society does n't ask for these oppourtunity . Students are likely to think that time to helping communitie does not neccessary . Instead of this time , they asked for them more high grades in their school and some qualification such as Toeic or Toefl grades . For them , community exercise is not their interesing requirement . During school period , students often worried about their grades and evaluation from their teacher or professor . In order to give a good grade , they have too much efforts . However , no one worry about their community . In conclusion , From these two reason , young people do not give enought time to helping their communities . They may want to experience this time to help other people . So , for solving a problem , both household and work place help young people .
(HIN,low) I am not agree with this topic because now a days there are many cars in all over the world . Since the use of a car is very common for everyone because with the help of car oru working process is doing very easy so i think that the use of fewer cars will create many problems for everyone . In these days without the use of car many works will be stop and many new problems will be created . Now a days when a person has it also shows his personality over to other . And in the twenty years I think that there will be more cars than now . The use of car will be common because a person use his car to go anywhere like in the party in marriage ceremony and for his personal use like for office use so in the next twenty car will be more and more common with the help of cars our petrol and fuel also safe because when we go in party with our family car is much more convinent as compared to other things to go . And the car factories are making now a days many cars day by day so in the next twenty year there are lots of cars will be availablefor different use . The cars are increasing day by day so in the next twenty year i think there will be lots of car as compared to today . Now a days car is making a status symbol for every one . Now a days there are many different types of cars are available in the market . There is a very big competition in the car 's company so after twenty years this competition will also increase . So at the end i think after twenty years there will be many cars available if there is not then we will face many problems like we will search for another things which is more comfortable as on
(CHI,medium) I feel that I do n't agree with this statement . First , The number of developing country is much larger than the number of developed country in the earth . Mang people in developing country wil be richer and richer . So they will buy their own cars in the furture . J ust like China . Because I am from China , I know much more about the people in developing country . In China , the economy is much better than twenty years ago . The number of cars is creased so fast in these years . More and more people are talking about the plan of buying a new car now . It has already been an important part in people 's life . Second , in my opinion , the number of cars in developed is full now . Almost everybody has their own car , and some people even have two . But it do not means that the number will decrease . In twenty years , people will update their cars more morden . But do not reduce the number of cars . So it will lead that the number is no changed obviously . Third , although mang country 's government begin to limit the number of cars because of the pollution . But I believe that the producers of car can find another way to avoid its happen . They can find out another energy to instead of oil . Just like gas , electricity , and so on . Maybe there will be more and more cars using this kind of energy in the roads . I think this is also our dream . Finaly , producing a car can improve the technology in many fields . We have no rights to stops it . Having a beautiful car is also my dream .
(FRE,medium) Succesful poeple are poeple who do things well . What is difficult is to know in advance if it is a good or a bad thing . But how can we manage to be a succesful person . You have to take risk . Of course you have to be quiet sure of your action . But what is fare more inportant is to believe in yourself . For exemple if you are a good singer but that you do n't believe in yourself you can be sure that you will never become a famous star . Of course taking always risk can be dangerous specially when you like it . For exemple somebody who likes going to the casino may loose a lot of money , so in this case taking risk is n't a good thing . In fact you must find balance . To be successful means also trying new things . But new things are not always good , you have to try before beeing sure it is a good idea . But in fact what is really inportant is to learn of your mistakes . For exemple if you try to passe an exam but that you failled what is important is to learn of your mistake so it will not happend again . By using this way of thinking you will learn a lot of things and than will be able to do them well . But to become somebody successful you have to take risk and try new things because otherwise you will never learn how to do things well
(SPA,medium) i am desagree with the sentence that the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide because I Have travel without a tour guide and I have have so beautiful experiences I mean it 've been so cool . of course I have travel with a guide tour too but when this happen the guide tour is always under presion of the time and you need to follow him all time and if you want to stop some times you ca n't and I do n't know but I do n't like to have tour guide . in other hand when I travel without tour guide I can stop wherever I want and I can do wherever i want , and if I do not know what places are the famouses of the city I can ask to the people who live in that place or i can go to a library and look in the internet the direction and then get a map and then I am ready to go wherever I want thus it is so funny because if I get lost I need to ask how to return and at the same time that I know the city I know more people . I know that it is a risk , because for example my friends an I are going to travel next weekend to Quertaro to visit some friends well they are members of my church , but I never have been there and no body that know how to arrrive to the city wants to come with us , so we decided to take the risk and we only have the map , the car and money , well I want to tell you that some times I feel afear to get lost or something like that but something inside of my is telling my `` you can do whatever you want '' ( and I know that voice is Good , and ... he is going to care me ) . so we decided that we will travel without tour guide . in conclution despite is too risky travel without tour guide it is better because is too funny and you can learn of your mistakes .
(TUR,medium) Human behaviours can be affected by lots of changes like living standards or technology or geneticly . Whatever the reason today 's adults are insensitive to their society 's problems . We can categorize these reasons into two groups such as external and internal effects which may cause children do not give enough time to helping their communities . The internal effects are the first reason that makes children stray away from their communities . Parents have the biggest responsibilty about ths issue . They should explain and direct their children to understand and like helping to others . In additon , television and games make children asocial . For example , most children likes playing with computers than going out . This makes children not aware of what is happening in the world or society or even in their house . The external effects are the second main reason why young people do not give enough time to helping . Competition in school or working areas make people work harder and harder . People became robots thinking only their things to do but nothing else . In addition to competition , money is another cause . Some people forget their culture and responsibilities to their environment n order to make more money . To sum up , because of external effects including insensitive parents , television and computer games and internal effects consist of competition and wanting more money can make young people do not give enough time and effort to helping their communities .
(SPA,high) I firmly agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to learn how to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts and data . It may be true that facts are basic for a successful academic career , however for all the rest of the human beings it is just personal enrichment . It may also be true that learning raw data is a very rewarding experience , but again I would suggest to focus this desire on more stimulating and challenging activities . First , facts are much easier to forget than ideas . I am sure that no friend of mine from school will remember all the names of the rivers in our country , but they maybe can remember why the PC has been so important in the development of our culture . Therefore , it is much more useful to learn something that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsense tough data , which you have to read over and over because it does n't have any logic behind ! Second , in our work we hardly use specific facts . But we certainly use ideas , concepts , arguments and logical discussions . At least I do in my consulting job . I have learned to structure my thoughts and put into practice improvement levers simply by understanding and applying ideas , not by remembering facts . Third , facts can be looked again and again in books whenever we want . Nowadays , there is no problem in finding information . We can just connect to the Internet , make a search and find it right there . When I do n't remember a formula , I just do that . Google is my good friend when I have memory loss . Maybe other people just have a neighbour that knows it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field . I could go on saying that what the world lacks are good ideas , revolutionary thoughts that can improve the society we live in . This last idea leads me to my final argument : facts are part of the past while ideas are the raw material of the future . The formula of a circle has been invented many years ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pending subject and only with good ideas we will suceed in this matter . We should be engaged in providing an outstanding ideas-focused education to the future Einsteins . For instance , during my education in high school in the USA I experienced a quite different approach compared to the European one . We should foster this type of education . Summing up , my opinion is that students should learn what will be useful for them and for the society as a whole . Consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .
(JPN,medium) Are young people tend to less-cooperative to their communities ? At present , some thinks that young people are not helpful to helping their communities . In contrast , some poeple think that they are really helphul . In my opinion , young poeple give enough time to helping their communities because there are many projects for them , schools encourage them to help their communities . Furthermore , the internet made it easy to get information about their communities . It makes them think they should help their communities . Firstly , I reckon that young people are trying to help their communities because I saw a lot of projects for them in my home towm . For instance , young people in my towm clean up the roads every weekends . It is because the city put information on the city bulletin board . There are various kinds of projects like that . Secondly , young people do give enough time to contributing their communities because schools require them to do so . For example , in my high school , it was mandatory to clean the river once a month . Moreover , we should wrote letters to elderies , visit their homes and have a conversation with them . There are many schools which do similar things . Consequently , I consider young poeple spend much time to help their communities . Thirdly , there are many young people who are using the internet and get information of their communities . As a result , they can realize the problems of their cities . In my home town , there are many students who are using the internet . They can learn about their town easily by it . One of my friends said that he came to think a lot about his town . There are many young people him in my town . To sum up , I consider young poeple spend enough time to help their communities because there are many events , schools require them to do so , and they can
(SPA,medium) I agree . The students should understand the ideas that they are studying . The learning process is not about memorize chapters and concepts , it is about understanding and analyzing . If they understand the ideas and concepts they would not have problems to `` learn facts '' . They would be capable of solve problems , which is the idea . Education is about what the student is capable to do , per example , if the student has a bad situation , a problem or other struggles , his proof would be try to find by himself what he needs to do to get out of the situation . His level of education would help him to analyze the problem and then , solve it . This man will think about what he has learned and after that he will find a conslussion for his problem . Other example , would be a person without any educational level . This person would not be capable of get a fast conslussion because he has not had any educational help in all his life , which means that he has not developed his razoning part at school . For this reason , education is not just a word that indicates `` go to school '' ( college or universities , in other cases ) , it is a word that indicates : `` analyzing '' , `` logical '' or `` learning '' . If some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pass that subject , he would use his logical skills to solve the problem . The most logical response to this situation would be go with a tutor to get help . I do not agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn facts because would be a support to those people who just memorize things and they call smart to themselves . In some situation would be good to learn facts , but it would not be the point of the educational matter . The point is try to learn and analyze situations in life . For these reasons , the understanding is most important in a student ' educational process .
(JPN,low) Successful people shoul not try new things especialy it involved risks . There are mainly three reasons which are life time is limited , people is not living by themselves , and we have place to lurn how to reduce risks . First , our life time is limited . If a person try to be a successful parson , it requres many efforts to reach the goal . At the same time , spending huge amount of time is needed . Therefore we spend most of life time to achive a gole , and most of the time there is no extra time fore anther time for spending . And there are approplieit age to do everythings . Second , in generally we usually have family , and we need to support the family . It makes hard to take any risks which may become a case to seperat the family . Forthermore , it is imppsible to throw away the family rerationship becase I believe the relrationship is the most important thing in owr life . Finaly , we have place to lurn how to reduce the risks . Even if a new charenge cost the own life , some people cannot stop try to start new thing . In this case we have pleace to go to avoiding the risk and get the knowlage before start new thing . It is universitis or colleges which give us the new life style . After graduet the university or college , it makes esier , at the same time the new thing become familiar thing . These three reasons are very enought to say that successful people should not try the new things with risks . And there are so many other choices and so many way to avoid the risk .
(JPN,medium) I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I have bought many products so far , and I am going to have to buy many products in the future . In my opinion , there are many products which are different from my image . When we watch TV , we see many advertisements , and most products we see on TV are very attractive for us . Companies which make products are in competitive situations everyday . They have to make better products than other companies . Advertisements are very important for these companies to sell all products . Therefore , these companies have to make attractive advertisements even though the product is explain about only good things . This is these companies ' business . I usually decide to buy products when I see the advertisement . However , when I wnet to a store and saw the product , I sometimes thought that it was different from my image . Finally , I gave up buying the product . It happens sometimes . Therefore , products are not necessary same as the advertisements . When the products is not same as our images , it make us disappointed . Therefore , I agree with this statement . Most advertisements are made to attract people . Of course , there are some products which are same as those of advertisements . In my opinion , we have to decide to buy products after we go to a store and see the products . Moreover , we have to understand that it is not always same as our images .
(CHI,low) I like travel and I have been many different citys , counties . If the travel group have an amazing tour guide , it will be wonderful experiments . Because maybe I can make many new friends during the trip , and learn about the history and knowledge of the place where we stay , and greatly my short life will highlight by the memrable trip . However , what is the best way to travel ? It could be great plans and cue guys or else other . And what kinds of tour guide is an amazing tour guide ? It is funny and rock question , 100 people must have 120 various anwear . We can not solve the problem to the rates , because the anwear is not we expecting and controling . If we want to have a best travel , firse we must make a completely plan , which contents the time we will spend and the place we will get and the money we have to prepare for . Second , you will considerd the traveler with you . If you like travel alone , we have no many idea to discuss travel in a group . So , you have to considerd how many people in the group and decide wheter join in the group . In my opinion , the people in the travel group are my friends . We can give hands to others when he/she is in the trouble . We can work together , live together , share the beautiful views together and have some parts of memory together . Actually , after preparing period , the people in the group can find each other 's excellent point . And learn to others . Finally , I belive it is a good way to travel that in a group had a good tour guide . It will be you , will be me . Just we can make the travel to be a great experience .
(FRE,high) I tend to disagree with this statement . First of all , young people , who take part in youth organizations such as the scouts do regularly provide services to their communities by organizing activities to collect funds to finance some community projects or to help volunteering organizations in their work . They also often visit older people or people suffering from serious diseases in hospitals . Secondly , I disagree with the use of the term `` nowadays ' in the proposed statement . Older people always complain about the fact that modern societies are not as good as the societies in the past . I refuse to accept this idea . People have the tendency to remember better the good and nice things they saw a long time ago than the bad things that occured to them in the past . This is , according to me , the main reason why societies in the past seem to be better than the society we presently live in . Therefore , even though people might think that children and teenagers do not help their communities enough , believing that it was different before is a mistake . People always provided help for their communities and other people always complained that it was not enough . Nothing here is new . Thirdly , the degree by which young people help their community depends on the culture and the tradition of the country in which they live . Drawing universal conclusions is acording to me not as evident when it comes to an evaluation of whether young people are involved with providing help for their community or not . As a matter of fact , it can be true that in some regions of the world , young people quite individualists in their point of views and therefore will not think easily about helping others without a financial or another compensation for themselves . But in other regions , such for example Chine , young children and teenagers get used to help others for free since a very young age . In these societies , young people will therefore quicklier go to help their communities . In short , people always did and always will complain about the fact that young people do not help enough their communities but I disagree wiht them . I think that these people do not realize that groups of young people such as the scouts help their communities as much as they can , that they forget that things were not so different in the past and that helping others without asking for compensation is for sure very much culturally determined .
(HIN,medium) Knowledge is an ocean whoose depth increases as you go deeper . So , it is next to impossible for a human being to have a complete expertise over any subject all what a person can do is have a good approach towards a topic so as to have the best available information about it . In my opinion it is always good have an idea of vairious academic streames and then cofine your study to a particular one when you have acquired a elementary knowledge of many . It is very important to have fundamentals of variegated disciplines , even if it does n't relate to you . Take an example of curriculum followed by the junior high and high schools where a student gets to learn almost all most all possible fields of study right from science to econonics to languages and history . This helps to decide what field you may take up in your future . Having a knowledge of different types of feilds exposes you to experiments . You can use your knowledge for relating two different aspects of study . Moreover it creats channels for the exchange of idea . Else how do you expect an electronics engineer to have a discussion with an automobile engg or a computer technical . We have real life examples like Leonaordo da vinci , Albert einstein . Who have knowledge of multiple feilds like science , arts , philosophy and have still proved to be geniuses in what they did . focussing on one single aspect through out your lifetime will lead to a wan and gloomy lifestyle with less interest to learn at a point of time in our life . Whereas interactions with vairious particulars will help you discover and energetic to learn . Having a broad knowledege of many academic subjects does n't not signify specialsing in all of them but it definetly boosts you to come out of the nutshell of a particular filed . learning is a process which has no ends so one must keep working towards the expansion of his ` Ken ' . Expertising any particular area does n't guarantee success neither does it hinder your path towards it , but exploirng different ideas keeps alive the desire to learn .
(SPA,medium) Risks in life There is a diversity of people , and they all have diferent ways to see and to take life . We have the ones that are `` laisy '' , that prefere to stay with their ouwn knoledge and continue life like as constant person . But in the other side we have the `` active '' person , the one that are confortable on having new experience . I think people have to be positive in life and while we are expose to new experience we need to asimilated and to deal with them taking risks and caring about your future . On of the reason I agree with the the risky people , is because I am like that . I am the person that never gives up during my new experience , maybe I use my experience from the pass to help myself guide and find a solution . These kind of people have a lot to bring to the world because they are constanlly creating new things and new ways of seeing things . Another rason of my agreement with the first statment , is because I imagine the future in the hands of people that infront life this way and it produces me something discusting . I am not able to share with this kind of people because life is a game and you have to play with it and be positive with any obstacle that could infer you during your life and take it as a risk that you could manage having a mental health . Finally , I will always be happy to meet risky people and to know that there is more people that take life as a risk than those who are afraid to confront life , this is why I am sure that sooner or later this kins of people are going to need help , because life is based on the future and there is no future with our new experiences .
(CHI,medium) There is a diversity of opinions over the issue of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , Others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinions . In my point of ivew , however , I fully agree with this position that most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they they really are for the following reasons . Here are some reasons why . First of all , consumers ca n't deny that companies spend a lot money to broadcast their prodcuts . Using pop stars or overstating their effects is one of their ways to sell their products . However , consumers never think about where these money come from and go . As a matter of fact , what consumers pay for what they buy going to the advertising because companies want to cousmers to buy their products . There are a lot of similar products in the markets . Only one way making consumers to remembe and choose their products is to advertise . In addition , companies using advertisements tell people that how good their products are . In fact , people always feel upset because the products do n't satisafy them . Take myself for a example , one time I bought a food , according to the advertisement , that could helf me to reduce my weight . Needless to say , I spent a lot of money and time to try it . However , the outcome was making me pretty upset becuase it did n't work even thoug the company has guarantee about the effects . After this experience , I never believe what advertisements say . To sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisements . My personal experiences and actual observations of life have led me to conclusion that companies spend a lot of money to broadcast their products even though their products does n't seem much better than they really are . Companies not only exagrrate the abilities of products , but also transfer the costs to the consumers .
(TEL,high) I agree with the statement provided that the word in the statement `` cars '' is qualified to mean only `` road-cars '' . This is to distinguish road-cars from other automotives , like space-cars , which may be a thing of the future . I will hence-forth call such automobiles as personal-flights , to distinguish them from `` road-cars '' . As a science student , I am totally convinced that twenty years is sufficient for technological advancements to progress to such an extent , so as to enable the the usage of personal flights by many people . In those years , people will be able to purchase personal-flights , and hence the usage of road cars will become outmoded . Twenty years may be short to produce such personal-flights at low rates . However although all people may not have luxuries to such high end automobiles , a significant portion of the population , especially in developed countries may start using them regularly . Besides , the government of those days might introduce other sophisticated public transport systems , like space buses or space trains . Considering the heavy pollution that is caused by the today 's cars and the great commotion caused in today 's roads because of these cars , people then may start exploring other options , such as space - buses . That would not only be convenient to most people , but also be environment friendly . In fact , some environment friendly countries , might totally abandon the usage of powered vehicles on roads of that day . People who wish to go on roads on those days might go on cycles , and it is entirely possible that cycles might be in vogue then . The usage of road-cars may be restricted to luxury sports like Formula 1 , Nascar etc . The other important factor that may influence people to consider other attractive alternate means of transport is petrol and other gas reserves . The acute shortage of petrol , diesel etc in coming years may increase their prices so much that people wil start abandoning road-cars . Even as of today , trains in Japan and in few other countries can move almost on the air , enabling them to travel as fast as sound . Current research indicates that space cars may be manufactured without the usage of petrol . They also do not cause enviroment problems , and traffic jams will be a thing of past . In twenty years , the advent of space cars and space buses is looking highly possible .
(TEL,medium) I agree with the topic given that is `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' . First of all i agree with the topic because when you have a good knowledge on the academic subjects you can do well in the upcoming future . Because now-a-days no one is looking for specific task that they has to perform so thats the reason one should have the concepts of all academic subjects . For example considering an civil engineer he should be able to handle all the problems which will occcur during the desinging , construction and finally during the final estimated cost of the plan which he has to do the project , so he able to handle the problems which are going to occur during soil investigation , planning and desinging of a structure . This example explains as a part of a civil engineers view . Another example is that now-a-days the software companies are looking for proffessional students never bothered about to which branch they are related and also they are giving training about the work they had to do for the company and they are selecting on the basis of the academic subjects what they had . From my point of view everyone should have a overall view about the all academic subjects to improve their sklls regarding and they can furnish knowledge on every subject and they can move relatedly to their work which can improve their living and they can be lived happily whatever resources they are getting from each topic and also they can improve their knowledge about the latest techniqes are going to come and accordingly they can improve their strategies what they had about the latest techniques . Finally my conclusion regarding to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject is that we can improve our knowledge on each subject and its modifications can also be studied to benefit ourselves and can live a better life which should be foremost important to us . This makes my conclusion about the topic `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
(HIN,medium) what is it that differentiates a successful person from an unsuccessful one ? well successful people dont do much different things but do the same things in a different way . i disagree with the notion that you have to always do some thing out of the way to be successful . sucess in todays world is always determined by the amount of money you earn but then suceess is a combination of factors like good relationship with family friends or the community you are living in. unless you have these basic things in life in order you cannot expect to be successful just moving in a single dimension . i am not saying that a person should not follow his or her dreams or should not try new things in life but before doing that you have to be rooted firmly on the ground . only from a secured territory you should go for exploring unknown ones . people usually take risks which comes under the category of recklessness not worrying about others or ignoring their resposibilities . i believe in the law of karma which says that whatever work we find ourselves in , the kind of people we are sorrounded with are all a function of who we are and a function of our past doings . to do the work we are assigned to the best of our ability is our duty . only when we follow this we will find new opportunities as we go along . to do new things and take risks we have to do it from a position of strength and for that we have to focus on the basics of life . we should try new rhings only if comes from our heart and not just for the sake of adventure . thats all i have to say
(SPA,high) In the past , the educational system was designed so that students would learn the `` truth '' . This means they would have to learn by heart all the capitals of the world and know all the important historical dates perfectly . With this methodology , It was common for a student to get hit in a classroom for not being able to do exactly what the teacher wanted . This concept of education is now days been reevaluated . The new way of teaching is much more productive . Now the teacher tries to make the student understand the ideas behind the facts and not to repeat them like a parrot . For example , is does not make sense for someone to know exactly on what day and what time did all the important battles in world war II took place , but to understand the historical situation that led them to occur . Also , the teacher instead of hitting the student for not knowing , he encourage him to speak his mind on every subject . That way the discussions on the classroom are a lot more productive . The new system is more useful , in the sense that the person learn how to understand ideas , discuse them and take a position towards them . The student 's opinion is given a lot of importance and so he will learn to think on its own and not believe everything he is told . In the future , when the student faces real life and will have to get a job , most information learned by heart will be unuseful . On the other hand , if he knows how to handle difficult situations and has an appropriate mental structure he will be able to do his job a lot better . This does not means that the students will not have to learn certain facts . Every theory is , in some way , supported by facts and this should not be forgotten . Personally I like the better system better . Not only because this way is nicer attending to school , but beacuse it will help us prepare a lot better for life . Although , as always , I think that we should not believe completely in a model or system , because there is not such thing as the perfect methodology . We should continue to learn and reevaluate our system whenever is necessary .
(FRE,medium) Indeed , advertissement is one of the best ways to reach people . But some advertissements seem the most time much better than they are really are . In my opinoin , i agree with this statement for theses two reasons : the use of very good commercials and also the use of the celebrities persons in the commercial . First of all , many advertisements have a really good commercials which can convince the people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity , many of thoses commercials which want a sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as htey will get this product they might looklike this person . For example the increase of the production of numerous medicines to loose weight in this contry is a proof that is works but at the same time the USA still one of most important contry which has problem with weight . Second of all , ther is a huge use of celebrities in the advertissements that gives a false image of what a product is really is . For instance , the last campaing of Proactiv Solution which is suppose to help to relieve acne . Personnaly , i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress . So when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol uses this ' it might works for me too . So ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change like i tought . Thus , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more products look better than they are really are . People should start to stop believe in those advertissements at hundred percent because sometimes it can work and sometimes it might not .
(JPN,low) I do not agree . Because the car is very convenient . Why will be fewer cars in twenty years ? In Japan , exactly , only some people have the car today . But What do you think about the car in the United States of Ammerica ? I think if you are in America , you have to use it . Like big country of America need cars . I think that no one found the train and so on . Because that need a lot of money . Who pay it ? I live in japan . And I do not have my car now . Because I am a student . I do not go futher way . I do not have much money . I do not have a car licence . And Japan is narrow country . So , I must not have it . But , I will have a car in my future . I need it . Because it is easier than train to transfer . I use only train or bicycle everyday . But they are not convenient . Not speedy . Not easy way . It need much time . Do you think so to ? Car is the best . I think it . Car can go somewhere . It does not have demelit . If you want to say , something to demelit of using car , you arge it is costly or no space ... and so on . Car will develop in the future . And I think it will be made us feeling more convenient . And I suppose like a train will be disappear in the future . This is probably . I hope we
(CHI,medium) Nowadays , young people usually use most of their time socializing with their buddies , having parties , go surfing , go skiing and have . They enjoy their life so much . They think they have so much time to spend with . They do n't need to worry about getting old . Yet , most sophiscate older people find their ways of life . They find their goal , their dream and they are keeping forward in their life . Cause they had been young , they knew they made some wrong decision before . They are willing to make it up for them and make a better life . To me , I disagree young people enjoy life more than older people do . Day in and day out , it is not hard to find young people commit suicide , they take drug and go to rave parties . It seems they are so enjoy with their life . In fact , they are wasting their precious time . Numerous of young people try to have different kind of leisure in order to get rid of their stress like exam , complicated love relationship , family scold . In contrast , most older people have experience to know what mistakes they did on the past , they feel everyday is a good day , they enjoy their lifes . They feel life is too short . Besides , they usually have more capitals to let them do more things like traveling . Most voluntaries are from older people , they are more willing to give . They want to help people who are indeed . This is exactly what life should be . Life is about happiness , older people arrive a destination that they can share their joy to other people . Next , when you see older people , you will always find a happy face from them . It is because they realize that life is running fast . So many worries that they had had before was not a big deal . Their valuable experience provides them with a critical thinking . They mostly choose a better choices than young people do . It always give a better result . This critical thinking makes their life easier and enjoy the fruitful result in their life .
(ITA,low) In my university students can specialize or not in one specific subject and I agree with this freedom which we have . Personally I think is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . We are living in the era of computers in which every day we can resolve many problems whith a `` click '' on our desktop and in which we can find many specifical informations in the world wide web . Therfore the knowledge is more next to the people than in the last historical periods . If a person specializes in one specific subject , he will to know only the argument of this specific subject . Therfore this person has a limited knowledge respect all arguments which occur in the our arena of life . Thus I agree with the statement and against a specialize knowledge . There are also an other reason because I agree a wide knowledge and it is that a person with broad knowledge can find work more easy than a person with a specific knowledge beacause he have much possilibities having more fields of knowledge . In may opinion is right which people do that they wont but is better for all to have a broad knowledge .
(ARA,medium) King Faisal once said `` working for your country is the best way to show your belonging and caring for it '' when king Faisal became the king of Saudi Arabia he 's first deed was to give people the cahnace to participate and do thier best in working to devolpe the Kimgdom of Saudi Arabia . I do n't think it will be fair if we said that young people do n't give enough time to helping thier communities , because if this was true there wo n't be amy people who will do anything to get a good aducation and defending the Kingdom . Getting a good education is one of the reasons that will suport my point . In order to get a high level of aducation you really must work hard which will take alot of effort and time . By mantaning a college degree the person will be able to work and make himself useful , for example my cousin is an engineer in a good company and he 's making alot of money for the company , once he got a rewarde from prince Nasser for an excellent project he had acomlished . Also we can charity as away to spend our time helping the communtie . nowdays all muslims from oll of the world are fasting the Holy month of Ramadan . During this month alot of young people and children are encourged to spend their time doing somethings good for the comunity , Princes Joharah opened an aducational center for orphens and had invited every one . I visted this center and i have been teaching children how to read and write Arabic for the past three days . It took four hours a day but it is reallu a great experince I think now it 's abvoiusally clear why i think young people do spend alot of time helping their communtiy . However there will be alot of things that might keep us busy but we always should remind ourselves to our duties to the communitie .
(KOR,medium) The question depends on how people keep in their mind which one is better for their life . To get a confortable life after young people become older people , they work very hard to get a lot of money . On the other hand , after some people enjoy their life when they are young , they work very hard to handle their family or theirself . In my case , I totally disagree that young people spend a time to enjoy their life more than elder people do through my experiance . I am taking a TOEFL test to get into a graduate school from Massachusatts Institute Technology in boston . Over the past 7 years , I graduates college with my greate reputation . I got a shcolarship for 4years , and then I got a job in the military as a first lietaneunt for 3 years . Moreover , I did not satisfy my life at that time . so I am challenging for my life to get better than before . This period time is very significant to drive my life . `` Do I enjoy my life righ now ? '' It is really hurt to keep doing my situation . To support my future life and my family , I am definitely supposed to work very hard and to get a job for my life . Usually , in Korea , almost all young college students would like to hang around and to enjoy with their freinds when they are college students . However , they never spend their time inefficient in campus because all of people want to get a job more than they expected their job due to prepare their future . At the end , When young people study very hard to get a their job and work their company their future , older people enjoy their life with their erned money when they were young such as to play golf , tennis , skiing and travel so on . My parents are also spending their time to travel , to play golf and to get a their hobby . They are enjoy their life more than me . Therefore , I want that situation as my parents who prepare their future when they were young .
(FRE,high) The main purpose of advertising and commercials is to sell and increase the profits of a specific company . In order to maximize their profits , companies are willing to do almost anything , including giving out false information . For many years , the cigarette was seen as a good product that was n't really harmful but provided social advantages . Many examples can support the same idea , for example , we see a lot of advartisements today about clothing or beauty products . In these commercials , models are used to represent beauty and to give an idea of how people should look like . Unfortunatly , not everyone is as slim and tall as a model and people start thinking that they should be conform to '' the look '' to be socially accepted . Therefore , advertisments often give wrong ideas to the public by forcing them to act in a certain way . Because of the competitivity of products on the market , commercials have to make their product seem the best and will often give illusions of being '' magical '' . This can apply to the cleaning products specially : they make us beleive that they are strong enough to vanish any stain . According to my personal experience , they do n't really work that way ! Sometimes , advertisements can reach the point of being dangerous , specially when bieng seen by children ; they can have the same effects as violant movies because children ca n't distinguish between reality and fiction and they do n't understand the concept of especial effects . Eventhough most of the advertisements make products look better than they really do , we ca n't say the same about all the advertisements because some companies are obliged to give away true information or else they will have serious legislative problems . For example , advertisements for medical treatements and other products that can put people in physical dangers . In conclusion . we should n't always trust the media , and we should be verry careful in
(GER,medium) There are some advantages in beeing versed regarding a specific subject as well as having knowledge about a variety of subjects . It is very common today that people occupy only a small vatriety of subjects . Such people are called isle - people in Germany . This means that people do only very well , when they work in their special subject . To my mind this is one of the most frighten development in German economics as well as in German society . As far as I can see , the human beeing is such a complex construct that must be challengend often . People should be flexible regarding different subjects to maintain the individual skills and characteristics which make them unique . I try to get knowledge of a variety of subjects , for example : medicine and english , but also sports , music and photography . It is a big advantage , for instance when you live by your own , like I do . Let me explain . When I moved into my own appartment I was able to paint the rooms by myself and to drive the lorry for my cargo by myself . Therefore I saved a lot of money by avoiding plumbers or any other speical workers . In reference to the job situation in my country it is also very important to have a wide variety of knowledege and to be , moreover flexible . Of course some vacancies in Germany require a lot of different skills . Because I do n't want to become unemployed one time ; I tried maintain , or precisely enhance my knowledge . A person versed in only one subject can only work in this category of jobs . It is the only thing you can influence to get a job in different spaces of business . So why do n't you do so ? Finallly I draw the conclusion that wide knowledge is not only necessary regarding profession , but moreover regarding your private life . One reason is , that the life itself requires also a lot of different skills , like beeing friendly , lovefull or even to be organized in reference to the household .
(GER,high) In the following I shall give my opinion about the question of whether it is better to have a rather broad but not so deep knowledge of several academic subjects or whether it is better to be an expert in one specific subject . Honestly speaking , I do not think there can be a general question to this answer . I believe it depends on the aims and professional goals a person has in life . For some people it might be better to focus on one thing and become really good at it and for others it might actually be smarter to become familiar with a variety of different subjects . Speaking for myself , I think dealing with a broad range of academic topics is the better choice . This is due to the fact that I still do not know what job I will work in later . I do not feel ready to already specialize in one specific subject . What if I am making the wrong choice ? Another reason for me to prefer a broad knowledge of academic subjects is that people who know about a variety of things appear more educated to me . Whatever question one might have , they always feel ready to answer -- at least most of the times . Now imagine you are spending time with a person that is specialized in one specific field but does not know anything else . If you do not happen to be specialized in the same area as he or she is , what are you going to talk about ? It could become quite a boring as well as frustrating experience . Furthermore , I am of the opinion that people who have broad knowledge in a variety of subjects are more likely to have a very successful career . We just have to look at high executives in the business world . Many of them did not specialize in business in university but they studied a variety of topics including `` art history '' or other subjects which do not necessarily have to do with the job they are doing now . What companies want today is people who know about many different things . As I said in the beginning this might not be the correct way for everybody , but with my personal goals it certainly is for me .
(KOR,low) I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide . I liked to travel . And I went to many country . Japan , Nepal , China , Kenay , Pilipin And Tywan . I went to Japan two time .. First time , I went that together my friends 10 years ago . Of course , we had a tour guide .. Guide was man and very hansome . He was very nice and Kind . He saied to us about Japan . ( history , food ... ) 5 years ago , I went Japan because my best friends lives that . But my friend do n't know that interestong 's plase and restrant musiem .. Her thought very simple .. Also , we make trip 's plan very hard . I think , live and travel different ! To summarize , enjoy and happy 's travel need to guide .
(ITA,medium) Learning facts can be useful for a student , but this cannot be sufficient for them . Understanding ideas or concepts contribute to develop opinions and a critical point of view about reality . In short , understanding ideas and concepts you can obtain a `` key of reading '' of the world . You can begin to think with your own mind . First , students need to grow not only phisically but also spiritually and intellectually . Learning facts by hearth it is not useful for them . Sometimes hystory teachers force students to learn dates and hystorical events by hearth . Then , after one or two months , students have already forgotten all dates and all related hystorical events . It is important , in my humble opinion , to understant the background of every event , and , at the same time , have the ability to collocate it in the line of the time . Once you have recorded a date , you can rebuilt in your memory the hystorical background . This is the function of a ` by hearth learning ' . Secondly , developing a critical point of view and a vaste range of opinions is fundamental for a student , because it is the moment when he is building his personality . Thinking with your own mind is fundamental to living in our society , where everyone acts only in function of their own interests . In a nutshell , to live choosing your partner , or which cloath you like , or where to go when you want , it is the secret of freedom . However , a freedom that respects and that take into account the freedom of everyone , as said the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau . Thirdly and finally , this is why I think it is important for young people having their own ideas .
(KOR,medium) Some people might say that young people spend their time enough helping their commucities indicating the large numbers of charity clubs or volunteer communities . However , I think that , actually , young people do not concern about their communities . There are two major reasons : they are busy concerning about their own ways and they spend their time for their self-realization more and more . First of all , current society is so much competitive that young people should concern about their courses or ways shch as getting jobs or their study . To young people , what matters is not the helping activities for their communities , but to find their ways in such a complex and competitive society . As modern society is getting more complex , the role of young people has been changed . It might have been to help their communities before , but now it is to survive in the competitive society . Therefore , young people cannot afford to give their time to help their communities . Rather , they are busy trying to get a job or study hard on their ways . Moreover , even if young people have enough time , they spend their extra time for their own purpose . From leisure activities with their friends to self-realization , there are so many things that young people feels attractive to spend their time for . Even though some mignt think that this is undesirable , young people consider spending their time helping their communities out-of-dated . For example , when I was young , my uncles usually who were young at that time were engaged in some volunteer activities helping our communities , and spend their time much in doing those . However , now , I find my fiends are usually seeking to use their time on their own purpose such as hanging out with friends , practicing their foreign language skills , etc . Thus I think that , as time goes by , this current will be spread out more and more . In summary , I agree with the statement that young people do not spend their time helping their communities . Nowadays , young people concentrate on their own lives so much that they do not spend their time for their communities .
(CHI,high) I have once read a book talking about different stressful situations people would encounter in their lives and some solutions to these tough problems . One of the unfavorable issues highlighted in the book is how to deal with a heavy traffic jam . Undoubtedly , those traffic problems , no matter in which part of the world , has been remaining as a big headache for an extremely long period of time . It seems the governments have tried every possible way to figure it out . Thus , here is our concerns : are these policies and strategies being put into effect ? In other words , are we going to see fewer cars on the road in , say , twenty years ? From my point of view , I assume the dream would become true one day in future , though , I 'm not good at forecasting things ahead . Firstly , it is now strongly advocated by policy makers to take public transportation system rather than driving private cars when traveling outside . As a matter of fact , this plan is working well steadily . People gradually have noticed that it is more convenient to take buses or subway to go to work and school than to drive private cars . Take the subway as a striking example , if you take it to go to work during the rush hour in the morning , you wo n't be faced with traffic problems at all . You do n't have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of moving your cars , in this sense , you can totally guarantee your arriving time at office and have nothing to worry about in terms of being late . I believe there is nobody who would like to be blamed by his boss every day merely for not being on time . Consequently , I found no reason for people to ignore the positive alternatives and still stick to his traditional and impractical ways . In this case , there will be fewer and fewer people who purchase cars , or at least drive their cars during rush hours on weekdays . Furthermore , the price of gasoline is increasing rapidly in recent time , which causes more and more people to complain that they barely could afford the cost . Thus , in light of being more economical , the majority of people would not incline to buy more cars .
(TEL,medium) According to my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Because even they do n't know the concept clearly it is not possible to solve any problem regarding topic . Suppose we have a problem to solve , then first we have to understand the problem clearly and we have to think about ideas to solve the problem . Then only we can solve the problem easily . Even we know all facts about that problem , we ca n't do any thing . For example , if student has given a puzzle to solve , then he knows all the facts about solving puzzle . He knows all the rules in solving puzzle , without implementing any ideas he ca n't solve the problem . The main purpose of implementation of ideas is to choose the shortest way and less time to solve that . Here for the student not only to know the facts within the problem , he has to know the whole concept around the problem then only he would get new ideas which are to be implemented in solving the problem . After the learning of concept about the problem we have to understand the ideas which have to be implemented insolving problem . Not only to learn facts , definitely understanding and let them know the concepts . The students who have learn facts , ca n't do anything without practical implementation . we have to improve them from the learning stage in practical method in every aspects . This practical method contains that understanding the concept clearly and thinking about the ideas to solve any thing . Its better to prepare them mentallyt that they are in practically . So as far as i concerncerned first thing for students is understanding the concept . At finally i conclude it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
(SPA,medium) I agree with the statement , I think that young people enjoy more the life that older people do . Young people have a full live in front of their eyes and thay can do a lot of activities . They have less bad experiences than older people , therefore , they have less suffering . Many of them do n't have to work , they do n't have to gain every day bread . Even if they work , it 's more like an adventure because it 's their first job . Most of them are single , therefore , they can make all their dreams come true . In the youth , time looks long . In that period , people have a lot of time in their lives . They usually do n't think in death and they can enjoy life . They have time to study or to spend time with their friends . They can make projects of many years and realize them . Young people have less bad experiences than older people , this fact make the life of young people sweeter than older ones . Usually young people have less motives to suffering . If they have a bad experience , they can forget about it because they do n't have a lot of bad memories . When people grow up , they start to have more problems . They have to work and pay taxes , later they have to maintain a family . In the youth , people do n't have to work , they have a lot of free time . They have the time to entertain with people of their age . When a person starts a job , it 's exciting in the beginning because it 's a new activity . The first job is always a great experience because it 's the first step to adulthood . This is before the experience become repetitive , before a regular job of many years . In this period of their life , young people are usually single . They do n't have big responsabilities and they can make their future as they want . In summary , I think life is better in the youth . Real problems begin after this . Youth is the time to preparing for life , also it 's the time to enjoy life .
(TUR,high) I think that every age has a different joy throughout a human 's life . Young seem to do more activities and anjoy a lot but this does not mean that older people do n't enjoy living . They also have fun but in their own ways . Young people have less responsibility so they are more careless . They only try to spend their time enjoying themselves . They live for the moment without thinking about past or future . They have more energy so they get involved in physical and outdoor activities such as sporting games , concerts , parties and parks more often . They are much resistable and strong which lets them to be able to take more risks . During school years there would be a lot of friends around to spend time together . On the other hand , as people get older they take more responsibilty so they change . Usually , after school they start working and later they get married . They become more mature and they learn to enjoy life in other ways . They may not go to parties , take risks or have a plenty of friends but having success in work , maintaining a happy family , having a pleasant dinner with old , trustful friends are joys of life that ca n't be replaced with anything . As people grow they see the world from a wider perspective so life becomes more meaningful and tasteful . Humans may get older and may have some disabilities because of age by time but living with good memories and seeing their grandchildren is much valuable than going into pubs . In summary , in my point of view it is very superficial to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . People enjoy every stage of life if they live a successful and honored life . People should live their lives in a way that when they look behind they should not regret anything .
(JPN,medium) In Japan , where I live , many people may think that there will be more cars in use in future . However , I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons . First , the price of energy will become higher than today . For example , many poeple prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy . Many car makers are making their effot to produce the car which need not so much energy , thoug , such car are high cost . Additionary , there is difficulty in developing new law cost energy . As the anove explanation demonstrates , in future , people use fewer cars than there are today . Second , enviromental problems changes peoples way of thinking about traffic methods . For example , in Asian countries such as South Korea , people put more importance on trains than ever because city enviromental problems are so serious . Originaly Seoul , the capital of South Korea , had not so enough train network . However , South Korean govenment improved capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people . The govenment will continue such effort to make Seoul 's air clean . Trains seems to replace the car-centric traffic system . As the above example demonstrates , there will be fewer cars in today . Third , purposes people buy cars are more limited than before . Car is not only traffic method but also the symple of rich life . However , people will change such image on cars . For example , in European countries , where many people use cars for the first time in the world , symple cars are pupular because many Europeans think cars as just a traffic method . In old time , people in Eurpope love rich cars , though , such thinking is changing . In such situation , they do n't need so much cars if there is other traffic system such as trains . As the above example shows . people use fewer cars in future than today . In coclution , I support the statement there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today because of the energy cost , enviromental problems , and limited purpose .
(TUR,medium) I definitely hope that in 20 years there will be fewer cars being used than today . Eveyday more and more people take air pollution in to consideration . People started to use local tansportation vehicles more than before . As the fuel oil prices increase the personal car use is declining . On the other hand local and or national transportation is getting more modern with the developing technology . Access to many different regions is easier than before . The starting point should be environmental pollution . If we want to leave a less polluted world to our children to live , may be we can start with our cars . Here is an idea ; when we are going to work why not driving one car . Collegues living in the same region can get together and drive to work with one car instead of each of them driving his or her own car . This is a very common argument nowadays . Hiring a minibus is an other alternative way to decrease the car amount on the roads . In today 's world people are more aware and conscious about the nature .
(SPA,high) In order to sell a product the first thing you have to do is advertise it , to make it known by the people , otherwise they product wo n't be sold , does n't matter if it is good or bad . In the next paragraphs I am going to explain why I consider advertisement make products seem much better than they actually are and why companies do this . First , we have to consider the subject of Advertisement as a branch or subdivision of Marketing , in other words Marketing uses Advertisement to promote the product or service the company trades . In order to make the product popular , the marketers , publicists and publicity companies have to make the product very attractive sometimes over highlighting the product 's features and benefits . Sometimes they create multimillonaire campaigns to promote products that are not necessarilly the best in the market . For example in Eastern Europe a couple of years ago , they make a very big promotional campaign for one car , the Dacia . The ads said that is was a cheap car , the `` car for the people '' they stated , that is was very economic , that have a traditional european design and that it will be the best deal for families and young people . What they did n't mention was that altough its nice exterior design , the interior was very poor and cheap , and even more serious , that car needed a lot of visits to the mechanic after the first 100.000 miles . As a result a lot of people was unsatisfied and agry with the company that told them that was the best option around . Furthemore , when we consider advertising to make products look good , we just have to watch the tv commercials , or the internet where companies promote their products in a very glamourous way sometimes . We can see beautiful models , actors or actresses talking about a product or service that is not really as good as it seems . For instance , recently a friend of mine was interested in a computer he saw on the internet , the design seemed very nice , with a wide screem and a lot of software installed . After a few months the operating system stopped working well and that computer did n't come with the original system back up disks , so he have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed to the same company that sold it to him . As a conclusions , nowadays in the market we can find a very wide range of products that seem to be perfect and that last forever . The true is that is not always the case and we always have to try something before we buy it in order to verify what the seller promesses just to sell more units .
(FRE,medium) Even if we all have been once seduce by an advertisement although the product was not that good , I think that this question is more about what the real objective of advertisement is : to demonstrate the quality of an object or to give to someone the desire to buy it . As an example , I still remember an advertisement made by san orange juice company . It showed an young teenager who was coming home after playing basketball with his friend and asking to his mother where is the juice . The boy and his life looked so great that for weeks I wanted to taste it . It happens that one day , I found it in a supermarket and tasted it , of course I did not like it but the advertisment has already done its work , I had bought a bootle of it . Neverthless did the advertisment lied about the juice ? Not at all , it has only match with what I was wanting to see and what could make me desire the juice . That 's why , I do not agree totally with the sentence as it is a bit more complicated . An advertisement must be due to a type of persons . To that group the product will seem great but to lots of other , they will not see what that advert is made for . Advertisments play with a whole range of feelings that a man can feel , it can also play with confidence . by making famous person only saying they use this product and not another one they manage to sell a lot . Indeed the man who is buying the product will first think as his star that this product is the b So in my opinion it is true that advertisements seem better than they are really but not totally
(CHI,medium) As far as I am concered , a people , need not to say , should specialize in certain subjects for the sake of having living metold , however , I still take it for granted that people should have broad knowledge of many aspects . This will not only make a person more knowlegeable and wiser , but also make the person 's life happier and more colorful . First and foremost , people will lead a more confortable and convenient life on condition that they have the knowledge of lots of different areas . For example , the people who has a basic knowledge of music , under certain circumstances such as pressure or saddness , will more likely to smooth their bad emotion eaiser than those people who do not ] : the people who are capable of playing some music instruments will tend to release themselves in playing some music works , which are entertaining and delightful , and few people will deny the efficiency of this kind of therapy . To sum up , wide knowlege will give us more ways to deal with some emotional problems . What is also worth noticing is that a person with lots of different knowledge tend to be much wiser than those who are constantly enclosed in a certain area . For instance , A people with a wider range of knowledge will have a strong ability to analyse the problems which bother them in everyday life if they have the concept of critical reasoning . This skill obviously will work wonder when people are contronted with a delimma , which forces them to make a choice , especially when it turns out to be relevant to a major event in one 's life . Consequently , a well-around person is seemingly more well-equiped for huge changes which are always accompanied us in every walk of life . Finally , though people ought to be brilliant at some specific subjects in one 's life , which is also of great importance to succeed in life , to be a person has the capacity of knowing lots of things also helps people a lot . If we are well-around person it is obvious that we will enjoy our life with ease and simutaneously stand more chances to succeed in future .
(SPA,high) I agree with the statement for several reasons . Many centuries ago , the total amount of scientific knowledge was not very big . One usually think of a man of the 16 century , say Galileo , as a complete man only if he or she master all the aspect of science . Nowadays , every specific discipline has grown to an extend that it is impossible to master it all . For example , lets concentrate on Physics . There are lots of very specific sub-fields , like Barion Particle Physics or Maser Optics . It is impossible to know everything about all the specific sub-fields , even if we concentrate only in Physics . Since it is not possible to master an entire discipline like Physics , I think the best option is to try to know a little bit about everything . Second , people specialized in a specific subject can find very hard to interact with other scientists . Every discipline has its own mathematical tools , its own vocabulary and its own way of thinking . Therefore it is really difficult to get a good interaction between a Biologist and a Geologist . A person who can handle many academic subjects can interact with a lot of people . Third , a scientist who has a broad knowledge can always get advise from a expert in a specific field when needed . It will be much harder for an expert to get an aplication of his knowledge in other fields because of the lack of knowledge of the potential applications . For example , it could be really hard for a Matematiscian to get an application of some probability theory to sociology . On the other hand , a sociologist that knows a little of mathematics , could ask an expert all the questions he or she has . In conclusion , I think it is a better strategy to try to manage several disciplines . One can always get advise from an expert if needed . Also it will be easier to interact for a person who knows about several academic subjects .
(TUR,low) People always need to learn something to reach good life standarts therefore learning is the most important aspect of humanlife . Everyone has a different point of view , about the idea of learning . It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . These are my following theses . Firtly , students go to school to learn something . Teachers are teaching them to us but we do not awere what they are . For example , when I was a student in a high school . My teacher learned me but he did not want me to understand them . Because of this reason , sometimes I do not understand clearly my lessons at my university . In addition to this , to understand concepts can help us in future . If we understand a subject , we never forget it , because we cover it all . We know every thing about it . For instance , we are in a math class and a teacher learns us a formula and he provides it for us . If we understand it how we can obtain it , we always remember the formula . On the other hand , to learn facts is neccesary fo people . Something can not be undertand . They have to be learned facts for students . despite the tis idea i prefer to understand ideas and concepts To sum up , as I said before it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is fo them to learn facts .
(ARA,medium) first of all having broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects is not better than specializing in one specifec subject . Because if you have many acadimic knknowledge in diffrent subjects you wil never by succesful in one of them because you have a shallow knowledge , however if you are really specialize in one specific subject you will really be succesful and acheiving a very high postion in your side . You can be the best in you major and u can really score a very big acheivment . But if you have a many acadimic knowledge from every thing you wo n't be that succesful person . You can be succesful if you really get deep in some of them or all of them it will be the best . In other term if you are specialize in one specific subject you and you do n't know nothing about a \ other thing that will be the worst thing because these days you have to know about a lot of things about whats goineg on in the world thats why in school they teach us alot of subjects and a lot of knowledge because you have to know about a lot of things . After that when you go to the universty you specialize in one specific subject or major , because you handled a lot of knowledge from school thats why you have to specialize in one specific subject . In my opinion you have to make a balance by the two of them because you have to know a lot about knowledge of many acadimic subjects and to specialize in one specific subject so thats why you have to make a very big balance in the two opinions . Some people think that you have to pick up one thing but i think you have to combine the two of them together so thats why you have to make a balance between the two opinions .
(TEL,high) CAR-one of the few things which people are proud to posses . Twenty years are way too small for the cars to leave the roads a bit vacant . A car is a basic need just as Food , Shelter And Water . The big guns of car manufacturing industry are spending millions of money to bring out more fuel efficient variants in to the market . Considering the present situations i dont think that there will be any decrease in the number of cars in coming forty years . There are countless reasons why people are so enamoured to their cars . Cars , beside providing an independent and effective mode of transport , provide various other services which inclide both social and personal . The key of your car is not just a key for the car but for a key for you to travel whereever and whenever you want . Beside providing privacy cars also prove to be status symbols in the modern society . Some of the disadvantages of cars which pave way for the discussion of eliminating them are as follows . Firstly , the pollution emmitted by the cars has put the environment under great threat . Secondly , with increasing population , the number of cars are soaring high . Thus resulting in traffic congestion and parking problems . But the manufacturing industries have been spending huge amount of money to develop more fuel efficient and pollutionless cars . And some of those efforts have already given positive results . One such outcome is the hydogen fueled car . These cars use hydrogen as fuel emit nothing but water which in turn is ased as coolant for raidators . And Hybrid cars are already on the roads which combine the advantages of fuel cell cars with the traditional petrol cars . In addition , these cars prove to be space conserving thus solving congestion problems . Hence thecars will continue to enjoy the throne of the roads till more cost effective and space convenient modes of transport are developed . And billions are hopeful that they will witness the era of Flying cars , transmitting the dream of every kid behind a window into reality .
(GER,high) As education is one of the most important sources to build a strong workforce , and western countries depend on their people as a resource , the concept how students learn is discussed in ongoing debates . Some argue , students should focus on facts and learn the important past events by heart , while others claim to understand ideas and to have the posibility to make transfers of different concepts is of more value . However both is im Today , we are living in a changing world . That what might be true today , does not have to be true tomorrow . Therefore , adaptation and flexility are very important skills . If students were to learn only facts , which could easily looked up in the library or the internet , they do not learn any unique skills . As well these facts might be proven to be wrong , if not tomorrow than the day after . To build all ones knowledge on facts is not very secure , neither provides it the confidence one needs to be successful in this world . Anyway , I believe it is important to teach students some basic facts in different subjects like maths or history . A lot of theories are based of these facts and one could only understand them when the facts are known . The theories a students should learn during his educational life found in a great deal on the layed down facts . Therefore it would be the wrong approach to leave out the facts completely of a student 's curriculum . Having build a stong basis with the most important facts , the education should furtheron focus on the concepts . students should learn what history has learnd the human race , what the backgrounds of certein decisions have been , and furthermore how this can be transferred into our present or even into the future . To understand the idea behind the constitution of the US , explains how the Americans became to what they are today . Understanding and adapting is far more important than knowing the exact date of the signature of the constitution . This could be found within one minute by searching in the internet . To be able to explain consequences and to infere possible results is only possible if one understood the idea behind . To come to a conclusion , the question is not whether education should only be based on facts or on understanding complex ideas , but how to bring both in the best way together to prepare the generation of the future for there daily tasks . To know facts is the basis to draw the interdependences between situations or people . To know when leads to the question why , and this drives our world into tomorrow .
(JPN,medium) I disagree with the statement that the successful people do not try new things and they use their preveous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task . One of the example I can remember of this is that a girl who always sit with me in my lunch period . She always worked very hard and I could see that she was a successful person and also will be in the future from what I saw of her . One day when she was doing her homework in front of me , I could not even tell what she was studying since it seemed like a difficult thing to me , she asked me if I could understand the question asking in the homework . I told her the it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she ca n't even figure out . So she asked me what she should do so I told her to ask her classmates and ask them what they have answered . But she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the people are not very intelegent as she so she can not take a risk . That response was beyond my expectance of what she would say . My personal thought was to ask a friend or two so she get a feeling of how she should answer the question but since she thinks she knows what to do more than the others , she did not want to take a risk of getting the answer wrong . In a way , I think since it 's just a homework assignment , she can just ask people around her . To this question , asking me if I disagree with the successful people try to take a risk , I totally disagree because successful people have a pride more than average people so I assume they take the way they think are right .
(GER,high) It is difficult to agree or disagree with this statement . If people enjoy their lifes or not , depends most of the time on their character and their living circumstances . These circumstances can be bad for young pepole as well as for older people . But I rather think older people enjoy their lifes more than the other way round . Most of the time young people do n't have as many responsibilities as older people have . Older people are limited by their job , their family and other tasks . On the other hand the job and the family can be very fullfilling for the older people and therefore make life more enjoyable . Due to a lesser amount of responsibilities younger people can do what they want and like . This greatly contributes to more joy in life . But there are examples where this does n't hold true . A relative of mine who is 58 years old quit his job with 50 and is now living a very fullfilling and enjoyable life with less responsibilities than even the young people have . Another thing which contributes to a more enjoyable life of older people is that they can value good times more than the younger because of their experience . Most of the older people went through bad times in their lifes and so they can value smaller things more than young people do . Furthermore they know better what they like in life . Young people often do n't know what the like . They are unstable in their emotions and tend to be depressed over small things . On the other hand older people are often less open to try new things . Therefore they might miss activities or experiences which they would enjoy very much . In summary it is difficult to say who is enjoying his life more , younger or older people . I think it depends very much on the character of the person itself . But when I had to decide between the two , I would choose the older people .
(ITA,medium) Personally , i think that it is very important for students learning ideas and concepts . Some people think the opposite , they think that it is better and useful learning facts , they are against theory , but without theory , it is more difficult learning facts . Learning some concepts or ideas it is necessary , it is the basis to achieve good results . For example at university : if students do n't study some essential concepts of some subjects , they do n't understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a los of time . Books have this purpose : telling the most important information , ideas about a specific argument . For example : students that want to become a doctor , before working have to learn some important concepts , they must know the human body . In every field of study , law , engeneery , science it is necessary having an abstract knowledge of the subject . After having known all the useful concepts and ideas , you can learn facts thanks to the experiences . Certainly , learning the facts is important too , but after a comprehension of basic concepts . Another example : in science or biology , people it is important knowing and understanding some concepts , such us DNA and so on . csyudents when go to school should learn basic concepts and ideas . Facts are useful too , in this way they can do a comparision in the reality . Pobably , learning facts is less boring than learning some concepts , that sometimes can seem not useful , but students without this knowledge would n't have a whole understanding of a subject .
(FRE,medium) It is a well-known idea that young people should enjoy their life more than older people do because they still have ` energy ' and ` time ' to spend , but if we really think about that statement we can tell that it 's not that true . Well first of all it depends on what we mean by ` young people ' . If young people means child , the statement will be kind of true , what i 'd like to say is that when your a child you will defenitely enjoy the life more than older people do because you 're still sort of unconscious yet and without any kind of worries besides ' what am i getting for christmas ? ' and so on ... But if young people means teenagers , student or young active it 'd be another problem . As for me , I think that being a teenager a student or a young active is one of the most stressful time of our life not that it 's not enjoyable at all but it 's a period where time flies and it 's a period that will define the rest of your life in other words everything and by everything i 'd like to emphasize the word ` future ' . What will i become in this world ? What will i do ? Well i guess those questions are getting unsignificant when your getting older . I think older people among all should know how to enjoy life the best they can and time . As we 're getting older , we 're getting wiser ( well i do hope so ) and we wo n't have to worry about meaningless things such as what kind of clothes am i going to wear to school today . Altought older people cannot as much thing as they used to do when they were young but they would definetely take time to enjoy them .
(GER,medium) Do young people enjoy life more than old people do ? This is a very difficult question to answer and to be honest , I wonder , too . But for sure I can give you a view out of a young persons perspective . I surely can state that I alway want to enjoy life to the maximum . So now we have a different viewpoint on this question , respectively on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . Maybe do young people have more and better opportunities to enjoy life than older do ? I 'm asking myself what is needed to enjoy life ? I start to think about what makes me happy . Time and money plays an important factor to being happy . But also friendships , a rewarding job , familiy , sexual life , inner peace , living standarts and peace in general as impacts on howmuch you enjoy life . Let 's take the first two points I mentioned , time and money . I already see a conflict here . When you young , you usually have time , but no money to fullfill your dreams . There are certain points you can fullfill yourself which makes you enjoy life at the time your young , but for sure not all of them . For example you wo n't have the money for spending beautiful shoping weekends in New York and sleeping in a beautiful Hotels - okay , fair enouth , not everybody is looking for that , but as mentioned in the begining , I 'm writting from a personal point of view . You start to study hard to become maybe an important personality in future so that you finally could bring up hte money for doing this New York-shopping trips . But then , well , you won-t find time anymore . So you always will look forwards till you get retaired for finally spending your over years earned money , but then you might not be in good health conditions anymore . My point is , to conclude , that there in every life-section will be certain points you enjoy to the maximum but on the other hand points you ca n't fullfill - certainly for that special moment not . You always will keep on dreaming .
(GER,high) Nowadays it 's verry common to travel in a group . It 's possible to travel all over the world in many different groups . For many people it 's the best way to travel . They mean it 's more interesting and it 's also easier to organize . You just have to go to a travel agent and sign up for the trip . For me it 's not the right way to travel . I like to go my own way may be together with a friend . I do n't like to travel in a big group . Together with a friend you have more freedom to organize your own route . On the other hand , it 's normaly much cheaper . The first reason I prefer to travel for myself is the freedom . I had the expirience in a group . We just saw that what the guide want to show . All the places we saw were verry crowded with other tourists . When you organize a trip together with a friend you can choose your own route , you can decide what you will see . You also can choose some hidden places , but this places are sometimes much more interesting . You can choose places they are not so crowded with many other people . You can say when you will arrive and when you will go . You are more independent when you travel for yourself . The second reason is because it 's normaly cheaper to travel for yourself . I prefer to sleep in a hostel . I was last week in hawaii . I slept in a hostel . One night was just twenty dollars . To travel with a group in Hawaii is verry expensive . I could afford this trip to Hawaii just because I selpt in a hostel . Otherwise the trip would be to expensive . When you sleep in a hostel you can normaly use a kitchen there . The food is this way also much cheaper . Normaly you spend an abundant amount of money just to feed yourself . When you cook for yourself it 's cheaper and you can cook what ever you like . You can take also a public bus to travel . This way is much cheaper than a expensive tourbus . In conclusion I prefer to travel for myself because I can go my own way . I 'm not dependent form a whole group and a guide . It 's also affordable for my wallet . TRaveling is verry nice and every person sould do .
(SPA,high) Education is not only the reason people get hired everyday for different types of job , it is also a way of life . To decide whether it 's better to specialize in a subject than to learn about many subjects is a lifetime decision . Depending on the person and his/her aspirations , his/her decision about specialization will be taken . I 'm more of a specialized person . I prefer to learn a lot about an interesting subject for me than to learn about many other subjects that may be not so relevant for my taste . In my future , I expect to become a proffesional astronomer . Since I was young , I 've known that there 's no way for me to become an astronomer if I do n't specialize in astronomy and physics . If I wanted to become an astronomer and also have broad knowledge of many other academic subjects , I 'll forever be a college student . Maybe that does n't sound that bad , does n't it ? But I would also like to raise a family and maybe , being a college student all my life is not going to help me in taking care of my kids . In contrast with being an astronomer , there 's a proffesion that requires a broad knowlege about many subjects : teachers . The teachers are like second parents to any son or daughter who gets enrolled in an academic program . And maybe teachers are divided into types of classes given , but a great teacher is the one that knows about everything . Sure you can learn about math from your calculus teacher but , what about a little history ? Would n't that be great ? If a person decides to become a teacher , this person must be determined to study about many subjects and not just one . Another example of broad knowledge is our grandfathers and great-grandfathers . What we have today is because of them . And most of them were n't specialized in a subject ; they knew something about everything . They are the reason our parents are here and our parents are the reason why we are here . Maybe if all our grandfathers had some sort of specialization , our lifes would have been completely different . So , in a way , people with broad knowledge were the founders of our society . But during this times , there 's space for everyone . You can specialize in a subject or not . The key is to decide what do you want for your life and to remember that everyone is different : I may be a specialized person , maybe you are n't . But we all are capable of learning and success only depends on effort , no matter what type of education is chosen .
(HIN,high) I agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . The twenty first century is accompanied with a lot of growth and development in science . Globalisation has led to a lot of countries coming to our country and trading here . This is generally seen to leave an impact on people . The cultural values are slowly fading away from our society . Young people are given the responsibility to help their community move ahead and have a strong stand in the society . Unfortunately , the younger generation has failed to divide their time and use it to the fullest . The cultures are changing at a very high pace . It is seen that the young people want to take an easier path and go with the flashy stuff . Little do they realise that by doing this they will eventually let their community to fade away in the longer span of life . They are so impressed by other lifestyles and communities that they forget their responsibility . People are migrating to different countries . Most of the countries have formed a group of a certain community people . But , it is seen that there are very few who work whole-heartedly for their communities . Others , usually either do n't have time or are reluctant to help . It is also seen that the younger generation lack the sense of responsibility . They have taken it rather too lightly . They will have time to go to a party with friends or go to a holiday with the family but find it too difficult to take out time for community development . Helping out their community is rather a kind of formality for them . They might pay the yearly allowances but never care to go and check if its actually being used to the fullest . Even if they make it a point to attend to it at certain intervals and make some improvement , it would make a lot of improvement . What is required is their full support and their ideas to help it flourish . They should realise that it is a kind of an investment . This will never go waste . The more they will help , the more the next generation is going to benefit from it . This should give it importance because if not looked upon now , the values will become extinct sometime . No-one will care for their origin . It will come as a setback later . The hardwork of our ancestors should not go waste .
(GER,medium) Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ? By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information . Huge topics and their contents can be passed in a minimum of time . But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned them . If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they do realy know it and will not forget it as quickly as they do if they would just learn it without understanding . So both sides has their positive and negative arguments . The quantity of information on the one hand , the long time argument on the other hand . Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not realy understand or would you be better of with some information you can handle and understand ? Well , the best way is surely the intermediate way . Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas . There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around . If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them . The topics are just to huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it . So one should not concentrating on just understanding ideas ( this would take a lifetime ) neither one should just learn facts . You would not know what to do with them . It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs what you have not learned , you are helpless . Referring for the question of the essay , there is no `` more important '' . It is as important to learn facts as to understand ideas and concepts . If students go to an extrem they will find out that this does not work . Today society is complex , the human nature and a lot of processes are complex too . If you study you try get in to a certain topic , a topic which is also complex . Just if learning and understanding are combined in balance a student can be long time successfull .
(HIN,medium) I totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ' Let me start it by supporting myself with a saying - ' WINNERS DONT DO DIFFERENT THINGS , THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY ' . History gives ample examples of people who chose a different pathway for them altogether to achieve succes in what they believed . Taking risks comes in way of trying out at new things . Of course people are worried because of unseen worries by selecting a path less travelled . Quoting names of few people hailing from different regions of society and from different disciplines but successful in there deeds - MAHATMA GANDHI , ELBERT EINSTEIN , WRIGHT brothers , HENRY FORD , BILL GATES , SACHIN TENDULKAR , MICHAEL SCHUMACHER . All these people achieved success . Success does not only come from a studies oriented field which is clear from the examples stated above . Every one is not created with a same bent of mind , there are people wgo are strong in sports and other extra curricular activities . They perform well in those fields but only if they choose to take a risk of choosing a track different from the usual . There lies the risk but it is only psychological if they are ready to work gard towards it . Who said success cant be achieved in sports ? Who said freedom could not be achieved with non violence ? No one choosing to do a regular task would believe the fact that a brick layer 's son ( Michael Schumacher ) would be a success synonym with car racing . Ideas develop in thoughts and thoughts have to differ to develop new ideas , and wright brothers are perfect example for that - noone thought of flying in air but their different approach led to the gretest inventions of all time - the AEROPLANE . All these factors sum upto a success story . New things and ideas and taking risks only lead to development .
(KOR,low) This question will have many different respose for each person . in my opinion is I am not agree . Because most advertisements must have determine to make products according to supply and demand . therefore , most adviserments must have control to make products . also make products influnced cause to price , etc .
(ARA,medium) Now days it is easy to travel to any country and do not get lost . Drictions these days are more clear than it used to be in the old days , or let 's say it is not as confusing as it was in the old days . you can travel to any where in this world by yourself or with anybody you know without having to have a tour guide to help you see your way . sometimes it is more fun to go by yourself and try to explore the country you are in , if you get lost you will find your way out , may be after a long time or after having a hard time , but the fun thing is to have the adventure of getting lost , and the adventure of telling the story afterwards . Getting lost will sometimes help you to know more about the country , I am not trying to say that traveling in to a country without a tour guide will be good advanture by getting lost but , it is fun in one way or another . Having a tour is sometimes a great idea in my opinion . The tour guide will guide you and show you the best places in the country you traveled to , such as the hestoric places , ancient cites , churchs , houses , resturants , and hotels . All this will come with great explenation about the past and the present of every place . Traveling with a group is fun too , you can meet new people from diffirrent places around the world and it is a great idea to make friends over seas and to know more about thier culters and traditions . I believe it will be more fun if you travel alone or with some one you know and spend time together exploring the country you traveld to , besides it will be expensive to get a tour guied . The tour guide may not understands the languge you speaking and you may not understand him , some times you will have some diffecaulties trying to get the gourp together to start your tour , some people are not ready or busy doing something and other problems that may occur too . If i ever want to travel I will chose to travel with out a tour guide .
(FRE,high) One must realize that the statement according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today can be easily challenged or confirmed This assumption is obviously inaccurate when compared to the various economic results and financial statements rendered nowadays by the car companies . Except for a few of them , such as General Motors in the USA or Peugeot more recently in France ( both experiencing severe financial distress ) , the major companies have increased their financial income . The continuous purchase of cars by consumers as well as the perpetual will to consume that characterizes modern occidental societies explicitely proves that the car industry is booming . This phenomenon is n't likely to stop , especially when the wide variety of prices offered by the companies ( from the cheap car to the ultra luxurious one ) satisfies every consumer . The car industry adapts perfectly to the consumer , and it seems difficult to imagine that there will be less cars in twenty years than there might be today . Nevertheless , this statement could be partially true , for three main reasons . First of all , major cities have nowadays developped various transport services for their inhabitants , which have the double advantage of being more useful and fast . It is unanimously admitted that taking the metro today is far more convenient than using a car , especially in cities where traffic jam seems to appear as the principle rather than the exception . Second of all , the price of fuel has increased in such way that it now constitutes an undeniable factor to take into consideration in the purchase of a car . Fuel being so expensive , any consumer will not necessarily be able to afford on a long-term basis the fuel necessary for his transports . Finally , the ecological argument is more and more put forward to demonstrate how the use of cars can harm our environment . In my opinion , and this could be a possible solution , car companies should definitely invest in new and proper technologies , if they do n't want to see their products disappear .
(ARA,low) we have here two obviously correct idea . I think that young people gives their coummunties enough time for these reasons . firstly , they spend most time on their home or around it , so the young people be around us almostly all over the time but I can say that was in the past . nowaday the young people had alot of responsibility such as school for adult or going with their friends to the malls or to visit the other city or to go with their frinds aboard to visit other country and know more and more about the biggest world we had live in . I will give reasons to presuade ( whom read this ) that my thinking is the better and correctly . one of these reasons is that the young people on the winter if they had a school they come form school which they feel tired and they take arest for awhile then start to doing their home work or projects or study for exams so they did not have enough time to spend with their families . the second , if the young people had graduate from the school they had feel freedom and they wants to go every where because their parents had prevent them because they feel that the true and by that way they can protect him so he want to discover the world which surrond him such as prison , when he got from the jail he be surprising and felt he is dreaming . the third and the last , that most sentific provide that the young people ( both the men and wemen ) had powerful that they can work 18 hours contrating the old men or whose cross this stage so if set more than one hour ( the young one ) he felt bord and he automatically live the places , during the old one prefering the sitting . I tell that because I am feeling the same and I hope that reasons had enough and presauding you ,
(ITA,low) I think it is true this question because the students is more attention of the facts and for he is more interesting to learn the concepts and the ideas . I think he is more interesting seeing the television because in the times means the concepts and ideas is very good for the preparation of the students . For example you do n't see the reality rather we see the documentary , because the first is n't shapes the mind while the second in the times shapes the student or all to think and at the reason of the world . Another example is in the university the students during the lesson learn this and in the end or during the lesson he asks questions and problems in those specifically . He shows interesting for understand the concepts and the ideas , and the professor is more content to talk about your lesson . I think he is for more reason that the students and the young he is appassioned at the facts in the world and to learn the what will be the future for we .
(TEL,medium) Now a days the technology has been improved to enjoy both yong and old equally . as the culture is getting changed , if the old people go with the change they mey also enjoy as youth . enjoyment comes from take the growth as benefits then taking it as useless The young people are enjoying more , as all the helpful in present day busy life . for example eating at fastfood centers then by cooking at home this makes them to use the time . the advanced improvement in computer decreses the work stress on them , as the salaries are more they are spending more money to get enjoy like buying sports cars and leading a luxurious life . The people who are old now where young at sometime before they enjoyed at their time . The people who are old enough are not satisfied with the the change in culture , they give more importance to the moral values , health , andtheir own views . if they does n't change their ideas they may not enjoy . for example consider the new year itself , the young people enjoy themselves in the parties and want to celebrate the whole day with many people in clubs , the old people may not go the clubs and gets involved in the party . they sit idle at homes . the movies now a days more concentrate on the youth and making them more enjoying , while the ca n't see those movies which involve romance , action e.t.c . I agree with the above statement that young are enjoying more than older . they are seeing for a temporary joy , as increasing lifestyle .
(FRE,medium) Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject are , in my point of view , both very important . But there is a time for the two and I think that it 's better to first concentrate on learning many different things when we can do it . I mean during our studies . First , when we know about many academic subjects , we can talk with lots of different kinds of people . For instance , in my school , which is an engineer school , there are different departments such as biology , civil engineering , informatic ... Before this school I made two years of `` preparating class '' , in which I learned about different academic subjects . What is interesting is that I can now talk with my friend who are in different departments without shame because I can understand a minimum of what they say and discuss it . Second , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can help us to know what we want to do after and then chose the best specialization for us . During my two years of `` preparing class '' , I learned about physic , maths , mecanics , biology , chemics ... It helped me to chose my department and not to make a mistake and having to change my education later . More of that , all that I learned during this two years help me in my education of biology engineer and in my everyday life . I 'm proud when I can answer to basic question about physic that , for example , my parents ask to me and I enjoy reading easily scientific magazines about different kinds of subjects . To conclude , I will say that the specialization must be acquire only when it is necessary . We can specialize after , in our job , but it 's more difficult then to learn about many academic subjects because we do n't have the time and we have more difficulties to learn than when we are a student .
(FRE,medium) The probleme of the number of cars throughout the world is often debated when talking about polution . Even if personal cars are not the main factor of air pollution ( factories for instance pollute more than cars ) they are often heavily accused of polluting because they give an example of individual pollution that could be easily reduced by reducing the number of cars . I however really do not think that there will be fewer cars in twenty year than today as the world population keeps growing from decade to decade . I do not know exactly how many humans there we will be in twenty years but I have heard it would be around 7 milliards . For a demographic reason , even if poverty does not decrease in the thrid world , there will be more Western people and consequently more cars . So we can ask ourselves the question how the number of cars could possibly decreases . It is effectively noticable that cars become cheeper and cheeper . Consequently , the number of poor people who will be able to aford a car will increase and I really do not think they will refuse this privilege if they get it . Mathematically , the number of car may exponentially grow . This growth tendency might be reduced if the different governements and non governemental organisations try and work together to control that expansion . The trouble being that they are barely able to find an agreement on other purpouses such as factory air pollution and water spoiling and chemical pollution so I do not think that they will consider cars like a priority . Furthermore , I don4t see the resaon why it should be placed as priority because when you see the amount of drinkable water decreasing in coutries like Bangladesh for instance , I really think there is still to be done before prohibiting cars
(GER,medium) From my point of view I ca n't agree with the statement , that the young people of today do n't offer enough of their time to help their communities . In the following passage I will try to explain my point of view and give special arguments for this conviction . If you want to have a discussion on this topic , you must first of all set a definition of what the term < helping other people > actually implies . To me , helping other people is evey form of making an effort to suuport other people in any part of their lives . In my social and personal environment I have experienced a lot of situations in which people and especially young people have spent a lot of time on helping other people . Starting with helping other pupils in class who are n't able to cope with their homework on their own , to helping other fellow students in university with special tasks up to helping old people in situations they ca n't handle anymore on their own . In my opinion , another aspect of helping other people can also refer to sport activities . For example in my rowing club is was a common procedure that the older members teach the younger how to row . By this way of proceeding also the younger members became awre of the fact , that they depend from the help of the older people in the club and as a consequence of that , there was no question about it , that helping each other was the overall principe of this sports club . This shows to me that in our society the principe of helping each other is widely spread , and that especiaklly young people are aware of this neciissity .
(TUR,high) Advertising a product is an effective way for companies to increase their revenue by displaying their products or services in various ways ( TV commercials , posters , shows , etc ... ) . It can be argued that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Advertisements will never show the disadvantages or problems with a product that is being displayed . The company of the specific product will only show the positive side of the picture , whereby they will exaggerate upon the advantages of the product . This is only natural , as they are trying to sell their product and in order to accomplish this , they need to catch the eye of the consumer . For example , advertisements or commercials of SUVs are always over-the-top . They will show their SUVs going on the worst possible terrains , showing how effective they are and they will always point out small details that make it `` the best in the world '' or `` better than their rivals '' . They also point out that their SUV is the one for everyone . That may not be neccessarily true , as everybody has their own tastes and not everybody is forced to like the same thing . The specific advertisement i talked about will never show how reliable the SUV is or what problems one can encounter compared with it 's rivals . Whenever a price is given of the product ( for example an SUV ) , that price is usually the basic model or the minimum that wo n't get the consumer much . In other words , they are cheating in a way because a consumer who becomes interested in the SUV will find out that for all the facilities the SUV has in the advertisement , there will be a big increase in the money paid from the price given in the advertisement . The companies know how weak the consumer can be once a successful advertisement of a product is given and will therefore make the product look like it 's the ultimate thing to have . Their only aim is to make the consumer buy the product . They do not neccessarily care about what happens after the purchase , as the company has already benefited from the profit being made . All of the above supports my opinion on agreeing with the statement that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they actually are , as they do not give the consumer a clear idea of what the product is really like .
(JPN,high) If I have to decide whether I agree or disagree with the the claim that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts for students , I would disagree this claim . Students need to have concrete fknowledge of facts to be an educated intellectual . I would like to give an example about learning a forein language . When people learn a foreign language , it is important to understand its grammar , how the words are integrated , and its pragmatics , how people use the target language to achieve their goal . However , even if you understand the grammar and the pragmatics which could be considered as ideas and concepts of a language , it does not assure you are able to speak the target language . You might be able to be a very successful scholar of the language , but you might not be able to speak the language at all . In order to speak a language , you have to memorize vocabulary and idioms and learn sentences and dialogues which could be considered as a process of learning facts . If we educated all students to become a scholar , the approach focusing more on understanding ideas and concepts would be effective , but students will take different carreers . Educators should provide opportunities for them to learn enough knowledge to survive the real world . Moreover , in order to understand ideas and concepts deeply , concrete knowledge of facts is inevitable . Therefore , I strongly believe that students need focus on learning facts , not just understading ideas and concepts . It is not only for students to prepare the time when they get out of schools , but also It will help students to undersatnd ideas and concpets more profound ly than when they do not have enough knowledge about those .
(SPA,medium) I am desagree with the statement because in my opinion when I travel I like to learn everithing by myself and made the trip so much interesting . For example I like to walk in the forest enjoy the bird singing and admire the nature place , using a book or map as a guide . Like that I learn everithing and enjoy in peace . Other reason is when you travel in groups with a guide not all the group like the same thing , some of them want to go shopping , anothers , go dance in other words everybody want to go for a different way an see differents parts of the place , finally you never can do that you like or enjoy as you wihs . If you go to a big city along or just with one person we always can share our interest an both do tha we want to do at the same time but when is so many people , some times we can not finish to explore the city because they are tired and want to go back to the Hotel , or the kids want to go to the park . Other problem is when you go in a tour gide you just go tu the places that they have in the package , you can not go anyware alse because is a new place and you do n't know how to go back , that is a risk . Could you imagine that you go in a group with your boyfriend and you like to espend more time in an specific place and you can not because you are in group and have to go with everybody have to go ? I dont really like that , I am better feel free to go to the places that I like and if I want to dance do it , or run , jump , play or be happy . Finally like I said in the bigginig is a lot better travel along than in a group lead by a tour guide .
(ARA,high) The importance of understanding concepts Learning facts is an important part in an educational system , but what counts most is understanding the concepts and ideas . First , if a student gets to understand how a certain system works , he would be able to understand the effect it has and be able to assimilate the informatioon faster . If he memorized it as a fact without understanding the concept , he is probably going to forget it the next day . I take myself as an example , I am a pharamacy student , and in my field there are lots of facts , as example , a drug leads to a certain effecs , but understanding the mecanism by which this drug works in the body and why it leads to this specific effect makes it easier for me to learn it and later use it . Another point in favor of understanding concepts is that by doing so , the student will be able to develop his logical and analytical thinking which wil allow him later to applicate what he learned in another field or problem . For instance , understanding why the earth gravite around the sun is more important than the fact itself , because understanding this concept enables the student to apply it to the whole astronomy field including the understanding of eclipse and seasons changes . Finally , when learning facts , students tend to accumulate information and stick to them , whereas trying to understand an idea leads them to do their own research on the subject , to have their own judgment and approach . They tend to broaden their mind and increase their curiosity . I think that learning facts is important depending on the field of study because there are things that ca n't be explained or are beyond students understanding , but what is the most important is to understand the concepts whenever it 's possible because by doing so , a student manage to develop his way of thinking and to apply the concept to another field .
(CHI,medium) As far as I am concerned , advertisements really are good ways to make the products seem much better than they really are . Especially in this modern scociety and during this commercial and valued time . During the history of China , there had been some kinds of advertisements in the big citys : such as the Changan city of empreor Tang . Some owners of the resturants putted the list and the main ingredients of the meals out of the house to attract the customers . Sometimes they cooked the meals in the front of the restruants and asked the customers to taste the meals for free . Accturally , these free foods were very delicious and enough for many people to eat , but if the customers entered the restruants and ordered the same food , they would find the food 's taste is just so so . That is the difference between advertisements and the real products . The products in the advertisements are allways seemed better than the products really are . To tell the truth , I really like to watch the advertisements of the make-up and orther beauty products from TV or newspapers . But I will not buy a product immediatly when I see a new advertisement . Because I do n't know if the product is really like what the advertisement says . I often ask for some samples of the product or ask my friends about it . I think it may avoid the risk of hurt myself . Anyway , the women 's face is very important . Adervertisment r
(TUR,medium) Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . This can be because of their selfish behaviors or not having enough time to help but it is obvious that this is not a positive signal for the furutre of a community . When I was a student in a college , there were some students coming from villages . They were going back to their families as soon as the holdays begin , to help their work on farms or etc . Even this situation sometimes had bad effects on their lessons , they had never thought not to help . Now , when I compare with the new generation , unfortunately the scene is not seems to me so helpful and willing . They all say that , they do n't have enough time to help their parents even just for a few week during their summer holidays . The situation is similar for the public buses also . When I was a child , it was a pitty to sitting down when a pregnant lady or and old men is standing . But today , young people are rarely give their seats to the others . I think one of the reasons of this situation is depends on the changes of the games of children . It was more training having team games than today 's personal computer games . Team games are joyful as much as the personal games and also teaching children solving problems and living together . Today 's old people are the children of past 's , and that 's why , we know helping and sharing more than the new generation . Whatever the reason is , none of the excuses are acceptable for me . Becasue I believe that as the time changes , people are becoming to have more theirself-centered life style .
(ITA,high) I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts . Learning facts is just a metter of remembering details . When knowing a fact is required , one can always go and check himself on a book . Lots of book have been written with that purpouse and there are a lot of written materials which can be useful in order to check a date or a name or whatever . The hardest thing is understanding the reasons why a certain fact has occured , the ideas that have brought to a specific event , the concept that lays under a certain episode . I think that the fondamental issue is to teach the students to become confident with this process . For example , once that a student is tought to understand and recognize the causes that have brought to the second world war , details about when where who and what can be left to several information that can be found in books . On papers and other materials it is possiple to find a lot of informations about the mere facts and every time it is needed , one can go and check . Students should be rather tought how to use these informations properly . Ideas and concepts provide a frame in which it is then possible to orientate themselves , in order to give sense to things which has happened in the past , which occur in the present time or which could happen in the future . We have to remenber that past can explain the present and somehow foretell the future as well . If students learn how to collect ides and concepts from facts , they are then able to give a place to mere facts . Well , I cannot denye that knowing facts and details do make sense itself and somehow it is also important for knowledge . However I think that is not the primary thing . First of all ideas and concepts are worthy to be understood , then details come . So , in conclusion , I would like to outline again that understanding ideas and concepts is more important then learning facts .
(TUR,low) I am disagree with this knowledge based on many academic subjects . I believe people should be specialize on one subjects . As the whole academicans know , specialization just include of this academic subject 's improvement . In the world history , development really related with specialization of persons . For example Alexander Grahambel just have experience based on telephone so that he could not be interest problems politcs within academic level . Especially this specialization getting more important when the academic areas becoming more developed . After the industrial revolution whole academic areas clearly and quickly improved . this development process directly has relation with specialization 's expanding in academic enviorements . Thus , too many academician found new tolls , methots mental way for developmets of those specific areas . I think humans owes to those specialized persons for our current developed level . We are appreciate those person
(ITA,medium) Is that possible determine a period of life for enjoying life ? Do young people enjoy life more than the older ones ? I bilieve enjoying life is a metter of state of mind . why ? I met a lot of young people who were only concerned about the future without living the present , in other words young people not applying the `` carpe diem '' philosophy , and I know what I 'm stating because I 'm one of them . We carry about the future problems that may cannot even occur , we do n't have time for nothing that 's not correlated to study achieving good marks and working . And as I stated , from my experince these behaviours are incriseangly commons . Now , what can be said about mature and more savy people ? They are often not so young and the have learned a lot from the difficulties of life . From that , these `` lighting minds '' can really understand what is really important in life and what worths to be worryed about . As a result , by using this knowledge and life experience this people can allocate energy and time to readily come up with good solution for the problems the encounter . For example , an experienced manager seeing his stocks going down does n't get too much worryed because he knows that 's part of the game and he will be likely to wait for better to times to sell his stocks . Probably he will play golf and enjoy his time while the youngers are desperate thinking about how they 'll manage to get rid of imminent losses . In sum , in my opinion enjoying life it is for sure not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind , and it depends on maturity and having a good vision of life . Please be optimistic ! Please enjoy !
(JPN,medium) To have broad knowlege is important , but to specialize in one specific subject is more important for researchers and engineers to research and develop new things . Therefore I disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . One of the most obvious example is in research laboratory . It is impossible for one person to have broad and deep knowledge , so we must cooprate each other . To research a big project , for example to make space ciatol to make nuclear fusion power plant and so on , it is necessary to gather the professional researchers and engineers which have deep knowledge and experience about it . Combining them , new things are developed and researched . When researchers discuss about some new penomenon , If they did not have knowledge and experience which specialized in one specific subject each other , they could get In conclusion , deep knowledge and experience are more important for us . They are useful for us to become specialists .
(TUR,high) I disagree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject firstly because it is impractical to have knowledge on many issues , and secondly because broad knowledge may not be enough for the solution of a problem and it does not promote development . I think having a broad knowledge of various different academic subjects would be a very time consuming attempt . For example in my study of expertise which is psychology , noone can be expected even to know the subfields of the area . There are verious areas under the large area of psychology like cognitive psychology , developmental psychology and social psychology . It is impossible for a person to learn all from these issues since there are manay issues that needs covering even in a broad way . And if we think wider of academic subjects like physics , chemistry and not the subfields of a specific subject it even becomes more impractical to possess a general knowledge about them . Another problem with having a broad knowledge is regards to its sufficiency . Most of the time we can not expect broad knowledge to help in specific cases . If we take the area of health and medicine we can see alot of specialization . When we have a health problem we are usually redirected to a specialist by the general doctor because the amount of knowledge of the general doctor is not enough to help us . We need people who are specialized in their area to help us since they are the only ones with the adequte amount of information . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is also problematic for the development of science . We need more specialization on a subject becaue we need accumulation of knowledge for a development . Accumulation of knowledge can be maintained only by specialization on a subject however with a broad knowledge you can not expect to come up with something new and to contribute to the knowledge pool . Specialization on a subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is more possible to achieve that knowledge in a life time , it is more effecient and sufficient for the solving of a problem and it promotes the development of the area by giving a chance of discovery and to the accumulation of knowledge .
(HIN,medium) The author asserts that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I disagree with this statement . As the many young people are truly devoted towards their communities . The green is the color of youth . It reflects immaturity , innocentness . They are the effluent sources of energy and enthusiasm . Any of the cultural , is incomplete without the presence of the youth . The most famous paradigm of a juvenile is the outstanding BillGates . He has not only turn the world by introducing the Microsoft , but also has shown a path towards an unprecedented software boon . He is the one of the richest person in this world . He has helped his community by yearly donating millions of dollar for the benefits of the disabled and orphan student . There are astronomical numbers of people who are young and who have contributed to thier society . Like the famous Sameer Bhatiya , he brought the revolution inn our communication technology by introducing the use of Emails . Secondly the participation of younger generation in a countries politics for the betterment of the society ca n't be overruled . Most of the young people seek oppourtunities to stand in election . Moreover the partcipation of the youth in cases of the crises ca n't be understated . Whether one consider the day of the most dangerous event of falling of the twin tower or it be the case of London bombblasts . The youth had serve very well at these times of crises by risking their own life . Thridly if you look at the statistics of number of scientists and engineers , one can markedly see that youth is fully devoted to its communities with the help of their individual fields . Every year the number of people going to the space involve the majority as youth . The most widespread fieds of biotechnology and neurology have their most of the aspirants as youngsters . Often young people are miss understood for not working for thier communities . People think that today 's youth is more involved in self enjoyment . It is sometimes stated responsible for the dangerous ails in th society . Like the increasing Aids , more an more consumption of alcholism . But the scenario is other way round . he youth has nowdays became more responsible for himselfs , for hie parents and for his communitee .
(GER,high) In this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people 's lives . First of all I have to say that I was born in this generation where the industry more or less cannot survive without advertisements . From sharing experiences with my mother and reading magazines from the '' sixties '' , even back then advertisements played a big role in selling products . I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that 's the best way to win customers . Human beings of course , only want to see , touch , feel , smell .. etc. the best a product can offer with the senses God gave them . Regardless of the fact that a lot of products have disadvantages , people are prone to be blinded by the beauty and the advantages of the product itself . For instance , a simple product like '' soap '' , has to fulfill its purpose . As a young lady I want to have soap that smells good , looks good , a kind of soap that smoothens or even whitens my skin . It is proven and I have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not . The low amount of customers that read this information stroke me . All what people want is what gives them a good impression in any art of media . Newspapers , magazines , posters , TV and radio advertisements will try to do their best in this competitive world market . In order for a product to seem better , advertisement companies would do everything to attract people . As I have mentioned there is great competition in the market . And I have learned during my highschool time of strategies advertisements take . For instance , if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular , like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eyes of the viewers by wearing '' NIKE SHOES '' . If one person buys those NIKE shoes , everybody else will . That | 's how we people are . I am aware that advertisements are exagerated and sometimes full of lies but I cannot deny that I am a victim of this trend .
(SPA,high) The statment shown uses a perspective which shows that most products display the beasr features an item should have , so when the items displays a lesser capacity , the client that purchesed the item has complaints about it and complains with both the company he bought it from along with the advertizement which influenced the purchess . This is not the way it should be , since the only objective of an advertisement has is to make the connection between the client and the seller . What happens in an advertisement process is : A seller comes to the advertisement agency and hires the agensy to communicate a new product on the market . the Agency then takes a look at the product and makes an analisis on which demografic is most sutible to benefit fron this pruduct , the agency then makes an advertisment campaign that best suits the product and releasesit to the apropiate media . This is what people see when discussing advertizement and categorize it as a form of manipulation , but bare in mind , no advertizment forces a customet to purches a product . No one forces a customer out of ther homes and thretens to kill their children if they dont buy the pruduct . They just display the item and tel people what it dose in a way the client might understand . If an item does not live up to the expectation the client had of it , its simply because the client expected too much out of the item . The ad agency is not responsible for a clients expectations . theyr only obligation is to simply take the information the sellers give them and use that information to represent the product . To sumarize this , Ad Agencies only reflect the informat a seller provides about an product , and the client is the one responsible of deciding if the product suts their need . Defects and other such problems should go directly to either the theller or manufactorer of said product .
(HIN,medium) Some people say that as the technology advance 's so will the manufacturing of the car 's while some people belive that the manufacturing of car 's will reduce and there will be an increase in other trasportation service 's apart from car 's . I beleive that there will be an increase in the production of cars . Firstly as there will be an advance in technology there will also be an industrial developement . Due to this more amount of people in todays world a shifting from using bikes , two wheeler vehicle 's to car 's because it increases the safety of the people . As time pass by old car will be replaced by newer car which would work by a hydrogen cell which is extremly harmless . By then technologly would have advanced and instead of using pertoleum as fuel product water will be used as source of fuel . This explains the reason as to why there wil be an increase in the production of car 's in the next twenty year's Secondly as time passes by technologly will be so advanced that everything will by handled by a robot . So an increase dependence on robot and robotic car 's will be the main aspect after twenty years their dependence will be the main reason why there will be an increase in the production of car 's in twenty years . In contrast to this there may be certain othere problems faced there may be shortage of steel which is most important thing required for the making of the car moreover there may be problems like the shortage of fuel which may obstruct the the development of the car 's because as time pass by our petroleum reserves may die down and thus the making of the car 's may be reduced Thus I conclude that no matter how things are may be there might be no petroleums reserve 's in the near future the technology will be so advanced that there will be an increase in the develpopment of car 's and people dependence on them will increase to .
(KOR,medium) Some people might argue that it is more important for students and some might argue that it is more important for students to learn facts . I most certainly believe that it is more important for students to learn facts rather then just understan ideas and concepts . The reason is that understaing ideas and concepts only offers brief summery of matter but not specific details . There are many are that students are required to know details rather than just ideas and concepts such as mechanism and history . First of all , mechanism requires students to know all the specific details about machines . For instance , if a student is to learn how a heater works , then the student need to know not only the concepts of devices in the heater but also the facts and details about how it all work together . Lets say that one student who understand how heaters work wants to create a heater . Even if he has idea about heaters , in order to actually make one , he needs to know all the facts and details how the machine works Secondly , History requires students to know facts rather than understand ideas . Lets say there is a student who is learning avout the world war two . Understanding the concept and idea how the world war two started would be important but know the details and facts about the world one two would be moreimportant . Thus , as can be seen as above , I certainly believe that learning facts is more important for students than just understanding ideas and concepts in that there are many cases that understaing ideas and concept would not be sufficience .
(TUR,medium) Today , governments try to reduce the use of personal cars . It is easy to support this observation by following the investments made for both new public transportation methods and recent developments in technology . There are various reasons for trying to reduce the use of personal cars . The reduction in power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are the main reasons to try to reduce the use of cars . Recent studies show that , in thirty years , the resources of fuel oil will finish . Since fuel oil is an important source that is used in many other important industries , the price of fuel oil will dramatically increase over time . This will automatically make people think about the alternatives such as public transportation , bikes or any other cheap device . The use of cars increased very much in the last twenty years . One of the biggest disadvantage of this increase was the air pollution . Scientists believe that , the Ozone layer is seriously damaged with the increase of car usage . Since this gives serious harm to nature , governments will need to take decisions to reduce the use of cars in the future . Today most of the big cities have a traffic problem . It is easy to observe the effect of increase of car usage on the traffic . Governments try to solve traffic problem with several alternatives . The most willing alternative is to increase the use of public transportation . Nowadays , extra taxes are required from personal car owners in order to reduce the use of personal cars . In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Lack of power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are main reasons why there will be fewer cars in use in the future .
(ITA,high) I agree with the statement . In the education of a child it is important to transmit him the knowledge of facts concerning history , science , art and other matters , but it is more important to teach him how to reason independently and to think with his own mind . For a student it is very important to understand ideas and concepts behind facts ; in fact , this gives to the student some schemes that he can re-apply to understand many other facts and he can use to continue learn also alone . Notions are relevant , but are ideas and concepts that develop in a young boy the skills required to analyze things and reasoning . In the past to know a lot of facts was very valuable and esteemed , but today , thanks to new communication technologies , information and facts are easily available to everyone and have lost great part of their value . For people today it is not essential to know facts , but it is required to have the capacity and the mind to understand facts and to find out what we really need among the big quantity of information available . Internet today is maybe the gratest example of what I say : in the Web it is possible for everyone to quickly access to facts that happen in the world , to historical archives , and to a lot of pictures and video . Ideas and concepts are also the basis for creativity ; discoveries in scientific areas can happen only because researchers have understood what they have studied , and have gained the capacity and courage to go further simple facts and to design theories and rules also concerning facts that have n't yet happened . AOne affascinating example is A. Einstein : with his ideas he proposed theories that were verified by facts only many years later .
(TEL,medium) Like many people , i too feel that travelling in a group is much more fun than travelling independentely . Hence , i completely agree with the statement . There are many uses by travelling in groups , spending time with family , having a guided tours etc . One generally goes in groups with family and friends on tours . This gives them an oppurtunity to spend quality time with them which would otherwise may be not possible . since these tours are generally planned during vacations or holidays , it makes the time spend much more worth while . More over ` happiness increases by sharing it ' as a quote says , the main purpose of going on a vacation is to enjoy it and be happy and going with family and friends increases it . And also it positively affects the interpersonal relationship between the members of the group , be it family members or friends or complete strangers . When you travel alone , you obviously wouldnt have anybody to share it with . More over the journey wold be more boring and dull or even uninteresting . Furthermore , when it is guided tour , one have the advantage of knowing the history and culture of the place , that one is visiting . It is always important to be informed about the place , because it not only educates , but also provides the necessary information . Going to historical places on a giuded tour is much more worthwhile . For example If you go on a trip to Rome or Italy , it is always good to have a guide because , they inform you with their history and culture which is infact very interesting , since
(GER,high) To answer the question , if most advertisements make products much better than they really are I want to procide in a certain way . Since the question states that not all advertisements , but most of them are making a product look much better than it really is , I am just going to give some examples in order to empiricly prove that the given statement is correct . In that order my first example is the Mc Donalds french fries . When you see their commercial on TV , where it is these tasty french fries just shouting out of that shimmering red box , they always look just fabulous . They are thick and have that perfect yellow-brownish color . And almost more important they lie in that box perfectly organized . Not a single one is misplaced . Comparing that wounderful illusion of Mc Donalds french fries with the reallity one has to come to the conclusion that there is a gigantic diffrence between them . That example hereby strongly supports the given statement . To give another example one just has to look at one of these energy drink advertisements . The advertisements tell you that by consuming that nice colored , always cooled looking drink all of your lost power or energy will be restored immediatly . Most of these advertisements also make one feel that one becomes more attracitve by drinking that baverrage . As in the first example the advertisement gives one an image of the product which does not correspond to the reallity . Altough I have to admit that I did not try every existing energy-drink I believe I can tell by the dozen I have tried that they are neighter as good looking , nor as good energy restoring as the advertisement wants to make one believe . As these to examples perfectly show advertisements usually make a product seem much better than it really is , which is nothing to wonder about if one looks at the purpose of an advertisement . Since advertisements are made to increase the number of sold units of a product , of course they try to make everyone believe that they are buying a perfect product .
(ARA,high) Enjoying life varies from one person to an other . It differs also from one stage of life to an other . Such an issue remains controversial , because it implies a variety of factors and elements that should be taken into consideration . Nevertheless , I do agree with this statement due to a number of reawsons . First of all , the stage of life ( the age of a person ) plays a pivotal role in determining one 's interests and tendencies . It provides a person with vision that enlightens and leads one to make the suitable choice one has to pick befre pursuing a certain activity that will generate pleasure and entertainment throughout the whole life span . Young people have got a lot of choices in life , because they are supported by their ability to do and pursuit a variety of pleasure-generating activites . on the other hand people who are advanced in age have got a very short list of options because they are governed by their advanced ages and can never pursuit some activites that require certain traits such as energy , mobility and agility . So old people are hampered by the age factor . In fact it is the main obstacle behind their limited pleasure in life . Young people are usually able to get engaged in so many activities of activitee and hobbies that are pecular to young people such as athletic activites and participation in different competitions that entail young bodies and minds . Old people can practice such things in a rather differnt mannerdue to their limited phisical and mental capabilites . So , young people will find the chance to entertain themselves fully , and this will eventually lead to full pleasure and enjoyment in life . However , the issue of enjoyment remains controvertial , because no one can define what 's real enjoyment ! The real meaning of enjoyment in life varies from one person to an other and also from one generation to an other . Even differnt communites an d cultures will vary in this context . Nevertheless , and in my own point of view , I believe that young people do enjoy life more than old ones .
(GER,high) In the following I will try to discuss the statement and show examples in addition to my arguments . First of all , we got to make sure that advertising products is a very important factor in todays economical competition . The advertiser has to advertise the product , because in the competition of the market there will be a lot of similar products and much more that are alike . The better the product is advertised , the more people will buy it . The advertisement has to be as funny , as inventive , as surprising , as basic as possible depending on the target group . Usually the advertisement tries to focuss the people 's interest on the product . Of course the product is allways presented in the best light and the weaknesses are hidden , but the people now have the possibility to get information on the product and in todays media there are many ways . There are papers on allmost every topic , from car to plants in your garden . The internet provides an amount of product tests and mostly the product is just a better form of a former product , that should already known . Because of these possibilities of informing oneself , I think it is not the fault of the advertisement if someone is disappointed about a product . But sometimes you get the feeling that the producer has spent more time on the advertisement than on the product itself . Only at this point , I think I can agree with the statement . But developing a bad product and only focussing on the advertisement will be discovered soon by the users and affect the sales of the product badly . Therefore I think it 's not in the interest of the company to bring bad products on the market and cut there own skin . Lastly , it is very important to be aware that advertisment is a necessary part of a product circle and in that context I can not agree with this statement .
(ITA,low) I think that the car has changed the life of the last century and it is an impotant mean for our life still today . However I think also that the cars bring with them same ambiental and social problem . First of all , the cars make too pollution , also new cars that they have so many reststriction but again today is not enough . Furthermore , the cars have destroed all kind of human ralationshipm whit nature and otherelf . For example , for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters , because , so they do less work . The people do n't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving . This abuse of the car is allowed becouse not only for the laize of the people but also for the bad condition of pubblic traspot . Indeed , in some part of the world , it is always late , durty , and sometimes very expencive , and above all confortless . In other words , these are situations that force people to take the car . Indeed , it has all confort that we want : air conditioned , music , space ... I do n't belive that among twenty years the car will be fewer , instead I think that the number will grow up more and more . This will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( I am talking about my particular country situation ) . Nothing is doing to change direction . On the other hand , somebody thinks that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car , but for my it is not true , for to topic : the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars ' factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life . IIn conclusion I think that the solution are two or the goverment of all wor
(CHI,medium) Many things in the world are so complex , if we want to get all facts that it might be take a long time to understand all . In my opinion , the efficient way to learn things is to get the main ideas and concepts , instead of understanding all the facts . The better way to know a fact is to attemp getting it by ourselves . If someone always tells you anything what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledge . You just follow others steps , without thinking deeply . You will not find other news dicovery , because you always think others ' opinions are correct . It will stop prodessing , and it makes our brains get rusty . For instanse , when I was studying in University , the professer always theach us the way to study , not following the books and reading that . The meaning of teachers is to help students find their ways to research , they can tell us about different fields talking about . If we are interested in some specific area , we should research more information about that by ourselves . Afterward , analyze the information and discuss with professers . It 's the way to learn knowledge , by means of the mothod and we can find more necessary information than we expect . In my opinion , the better way to study is to understand main ideas and concepts . If we just follow ours ' opinions , we can just stay in the same place , without process . We should think something by ourselves , and it is possible for us to learn more things which we should know .
(TUR,medium) the age is not the basic thing when the topic ic enjoying life . if a person is optimistic in his nature whatever his age is he can not enjoy life . young people have more energy to live and willingness to do things about life . but it does not show that they enjoy life more . most of the old poeple are smiling more than young people . especially in the last 10 or 20 years most of the young people have lost their energy to live . they are more depressive and optimistic than earlier generations . they do not satisfy from anything they get . they always want more and more . earlier generations know to satify with the things they have . and they could be happy even by a small surprise . it is because the new era we live in which directs us to consume everything we see and have . so our children does not know how to be happy and how to enjoy life . they spend their energy to consume only . by this situation we can say that our older people enjoy life more . when you look around yourself you will see that in the places where nature fresh air the proof of life stands there are older people more then younger ones . younger people are the shopping malls cinemasor at the take aways . so how can we say that they know how to enjoy life . they even do not know the source of life the mother earth . they only see things on tv . they do not speak and smile much . they thought they are cool and carismatic by not smiling . but enjoying life is smiling laughing . younger people do not curious about thing around them . they got used to consume the things given to them . but you have to be curious about life to be able to enjoy it . in conclusion may be we can say that 20 years ago younger people enjoy life more but not nowadays and it does not seem they will in the future .
(ITA,low) I agree with the following statement . The young people can have more situation for enjoy thieir life then the older person . First of all , to school the young people can meet their friends on day and can play and study with them , two things more funny than work . The older poeple probably they must work in a day and do n't have the same situation for enjoy thierself . Second , the young person has more time to spend in a play then the older person . In my opinion an older person do n't want play with his friends because does n't have any time . Third , the young person is free to do all thing that he want . He is free to jump , is free to smile and is free to follow all of his behavior . The older person ca n't do it because in a particula work situation he must have a particolar behavior . For example in office , the worker ca n't speak free , ca n't sing . That all , by .
(ITA,high) I personally do not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take the risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well . In fact I think that is not a matter of being successful that pushes people to try new things and to take the risks . Actually successful people are very much concerned about their knoweldge and probably are not likely to risk because they do not want to loose their popularity . For examples a brillant manager knows exactly what his \ her skills are and therefore he \ she would never try to do something new because of uncertain and risk that can lead to their replacement by someonelse who is better than he \ she is in that particular issue . It seems strange that someone who is already successful and knows how to do something well does n't want to try or does n't take the risk . Normaly these kind of people should have a strong character and therefore the wright spirit to challenge themselves in new things . But the surprising thing is that they are the one who have hard time realizing that they are valid persons and that if they have achieved certain success is because they have the qualities required . I think that these type of persons , unfortunately , have a big lack in their personality . In fact they seem not to be self confident even if they would not revelate to the pubblic . Furthermore I belive that people who are not successful are more willing to try new things and to risk . First of all because they have nothing to loose and second because in this manner they will have a chance to show their capabilities and to create a stronger character by challenging themselves .
(SPA,low) I am disagree with this statement . If you learn with statements it will be more simple to learn and archieve in the mind . You can learn for what you need that for , see what is the important to learn , situations , will not be only ideas , concepts and theory . It will be more fun for students . When a math teacher give the class the students dont know for what they have to learn that thay always say is `` for what i need to learn that i dont going to be a CPA '' . But if they teach the kids the facts for what the need to learn that , the importance to need that to be someone in the world . They only learn the concepts take the exams get an A and then what . They go out to difficult world without knowing for what they are going to use the concepts . That is one of the big problems of the US nation , what I 'm going to study now ? . Millions of students graduate every year without knowing what they are going to study . Brilliant students working in foodcourts , why ? because they know to much they graduate with 4.00 points but they dont know where to go know . That orientation does n't exist , thats why I think that the best way to a student can learn is by facts , so he can know before he goes out from school in what he is good for .
(ARA,low) In fact some people think that after twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Some of them expect that the saince will have an explotion in the future and there will be some new vaicles . In my opinion there will be fewer cars but not in the twenty years or even therty , in the far future . cars are very important for alot of peple and they are nessacary in our life . Some country cannot reduce there cars beacuse of many reasons . The first and the most important reason is that they donnot apprepared for that yet . They do n't have other way or method to reduce the avrage of cars . However , they know that the cars causes alot of problems for the human , animals and the envairomet . Second the popul
(KOR,medium) I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . First people who try new things can have more chance to make a success . I have seen the TV program showed how one of Korean business man got succeed and able to finally export electronical devices to US . He used to be a engineer in a small electronical company . His salary was good and economically stable . However , in spite of negative opinoins from friends and families , he decided to leave company and make a new one because he had lots of idea and experiences for the electronical devices . Initial period , he failed many times due to lack of experience in marketing and so on . However he tried many other things like change the design of the product and collaborate people who knows marketing and business . Now he is a CEO in the big company that earns $ milions per year . People who is willing to take risks can have more chance to succeed . My mom was poorly educated . She always has passion and will in her mind for further education like going high school and college . Though she has two kinds and families that she has to take care , she decided and started to search what she has to do for further education . She took many lessons from the private institutes and took exams to obtain the graduate certificate for the middle school and high school . Now she is trying to go for the college to study what she wanted to study like English literature . She gave much more chances and opportunities to herself by trying new things like learning things from different places .
(HIN,high) I support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I would like to support this with the following observations from my personal experiences . With the advent of technology , a greater number of means are available for young people to enjoy life . When I was kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in India . Now kids at young age have different options such as video games which I never had an access to . This translates to the older people too , who would have no access to these gadgets . Even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these devices . In the era of consumerism more and more products are offered for the young generation because they control the spending . Companies that tailor their offerings to the old people are between far and few . I feel this also has to do with the age . As people grow they become more mature , their interests change and they also tend be more appreciative of the needs of the family members . As a result they curb their activities and go into their own shell . Last but not the least , with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailments that take off their most time . They have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activities which they would have done in their younger years . Having said that young people enjoy life more , I would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all . But as discussed above the means change as the time passes and they start limiting their activities .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . To discuss it , I need to difine the meaning of `` successful people '' for me . Successful people are people who found out their meaning of life . To discover it , the process of seeking is neccessary . The process is the same as trying new things . Trying new things takes risks . I call people who are doing same things without taking risks as `` unsuccessful people '' . It is because they do not live their life thoroughly . They already stop seeking . It means they are loosing their chance to find the meaning of life . It is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them . Therefore searching it is very important factor for thier success . For example , Michael Jodan , one of the most famous basketball player in the world , was used to be a baseball player when he was a child . When he entered high school , he started to play basketball . Then he realized it was the best thing to do for him . However , he was not sure about he could become a professional bascketball player . But he tried it and made it . He retired already , but everyone of basketball fun remenbers him vividly . Another example is Roger Federer , No.1 tennis player in the world . Like Michael Jordan , he also did not know he was good at tennis until he became a journior high school student . He was not a strong player before then . Finally , as I stated above , I believe trying new things with taking risks are important element for successful people . Life is not an easy thing . To succeed in the real meaning , I have to keep serching the meaning of it .
(JPN,medium) I love traveling to some place where I have never been . If I go there , I will see something which is attractive or interesting and I have never seen before . It must be exciting . I have been to Hawaii seven times . Although all trips were alone , I had great time and also I have experiened that I have never done and I could to see my best friends . Thus , I disagree with this sentence . First of all , triping by myself is always solitary , I many time felt that I want to go home and too much tree time because of alone . However , If you are alone , you could do whatever you want and you could go wherever you want all the time without caring other 's feeling . In addition , for me , it is easir to speak to other people who are strangers or other tourists or native people than If coming there in groups , because I need to think about what time is supposed to see others and how they feel about it . So , if I go to travel alone , it make me feel more free than other . Next , I met my best friends in Hawaii . Then , I was walking among beach by myself . And I was very free , also I do not have anything what to do . So I spoke to a guy who is going to be my best friend . He is a great person and very considereate . All my this trip , he took me to a lot of places and let me stay his home for 2 weeks with delicious foods . I think if I came there as groups , he could not accept me and he could not take many places , because of alone . Inconclusion , I think that traving alone is more reflexible and more callenge and adventure eventhough there are a lot of possibility to face to danger . And , you could do whatever you want again . I think it is even possible to love somebody . There are more oppotunity to see someone who is important and to study from everything that I have seen and to think about my future slowly .
(SPA,low) Sure , I think the successful people always take risk and try new things because they have high self - confidence , they believe on every idea that he or she is thinking and sacrify . While other kind of persons keeps doing the same thing all the time because they fell save . The successful person always see the world like a place to develop new projects , although maybe , these will not have the good result . But there , is playing a specially situation , the self-confidence . A success person not always have all the idea like a glass , because in this world there are a lot information . But , They take or use all the information first , to develop things . Maybe they will take much time to have the answer but one day , they can have a excellent project . Second , if person believe that her or his idea is good , this person will finish it . But one person that always play to keep save never have a new idea to follow . Third , all these characteristics , after mentionate , are important but the sacrify is necesary , too . One persona who does not have sacried something never will reach a subject in her or his life .
(GER,medium) I do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . It is getting more and more affordable , even for younger people who have just gotten their driver 's licence , to own a car . So there are much more , rather young people driving than in the past and I do not think that this will change . So this is a constant in my considerations . Not only that more young people possess cars , also people that are older will still be driving when they are at the age of 75 or 80 , because people become older but will stay mentally and psychologically fit even in higher ages and will not give up on driving since it will - in twenty years like nowadays - be important for humans to be flexible and be able to move wherever and whenever you want to . Regardless of high car-densities that can already been found today , people will not give up on their cars because they have gotten used to the convenience of driving . Some sort of exploring-mentality will force human beings to even drive further than today . With new car technology that will probably been found in twenty years that should not be a problem . Another important fact in this consideration is the role of countries like China and India . They are about to step up as progressive states in which industrialization takes place . Of course there will be high demands of cars in the upcoming years . With its billions of people these two countries will have a tremendous impact on the usage of cars in the future . More and more people there will be able to finance a car and - with the course of industrialization - will buy one . Under these circumstances it will be important to find new solutions for avoiding high-traffic in urban areas and pollution of the environment .
(TEL,high) `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . My decision to agree or disagree on this topic might depend a lot on the definitions of young people and old people . Let us decide , for the sake of clarity that a young person is someone who is below the age of 25 , who is still in undergraduate college and older people are people above the age of 50 who have achieved financial securities in their lives and are about to attain their retirement age . Still with this definition too , its hard to actually quantify enjoyment . Looking at the situtation from a broader perspective though , I would sure say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Let me put forward a case which might explain my point in detail . Take for example , the things that young people do in their leisure time . They hang around with their girl friends / boy friends and other close friends , they party out , they go for movies , discotheques and they take pleasue from all sorts of entertainments available on this planet . On the other hand , you would n't expect the same behaviour from older people . They would rather stay at home and enjoy the pleasure and warmth the home has to provide . Sipping by the sunday afternoon 's tea , eating biscuits , watching their grandsons play in the garden is how many old people visualize their leisure time to be spent . They have actually witnessed a lot in the 50 years span of their lives , that these little things in nature bring a great deal of enjoyment to them than anything else . Also , older people benefit a great deal through their experience . They know how the world works . They are better equiped with dealing the ups and downs of life . Also , they have financial security and are more cautious in the decisions they make . Thus , a great deal of your happiness depends on these small things in life . Older people are better organized in sorting out these small things in life . On the other hand , most youth are in a confused state of mind . They 're still maturing day by day learning how cruel the world can be at times . Also , they are not financially secure . Young people often take decisions in haste for which they repent later . Thus , as we have seen above , `` enjoyment '' depends a great deal on how it is quantified and defined . It rather depends on a particular individual as to whether he has enjoyed his life more in his youth or when his hairs turned grey . But it so happens , that your best years are your undergraduate years when you study in college and are away from your parents . This is the time where you meet new people and foster relations that you remember them for the rest of your life . So looking objectively at the situation , young people can get a great deal out of life than their older counterparts can .
(KOR,medium) I do not agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Traveling is very personal and inter-personal experience . First , when we are traveling , we are departed from all that surrounded us in ordinary life . We meet different kind of people , nature and culture from what we 've accostomed . And the experiences reflecet who I am , and who I have been . This kind of experience is so personal innately that a guided tour in a group cannot give the essentials . When we travel in a group by a tour guide , we cannot determine even to leave or stay more at the place by ourselves . We cannot imagine other alternatives to guided by our heart 's going . Second , if we expect something more in travelling than just sightseeing , we should meet the culture and people with landscape . You can say that a group tour is better to know more people each other . I can get friends who travel with me by group , but the people who travel with me by group are likely have the same kind of culture and environment of me . We usually live by one 's own view and sight and the view of value and world does not change just as times go by . Different and external stimulus can infulence our minds and behavior more significantly . Guided-tours have traditionally too tight schedule to respond with the external environment or to communicate with people who live the tour place . In my opinion , the best way to travel is to travel alone or with someone who can share the personal and independent experiences .
(CHI,medium) Is there fewer cars in twenty years than there are today ? Although there are many variables and uncertainties may affect the number of car , I agree with the statement . First , the airpollusion is geting more and more serious . In the last centry , the human beings have made too many cars . In some big city , the exhaust of car is the main reason to cause breath illness . The goverment also notices that , and it tries to prevent the problem getting worse . One way is to reduce the number of car . Besides , to drive in the rush hour in the city drives all drivers crazy , and it is almost impossible to find a parking lot in the down town . The trafic problem in the city also attract people to go to work by taking public transportation , and give up their desire to own their cars . The number and quality of public transportation are growing in most countries , and I think it can replace the role of car in the twenty years . Finally , the oil price now has raised about three times as three years before . The pertroliem will be depleted someday , and people 's concern about the problem is reflected on the price now . So the cost to maintain the car is much higher than before . I believe under the presure of rapid growth of oil price , people will turms to other choices , such as bicycle and bus , and the the number of cars will be reduced . All in all , I regard that almost all the varibles do not promote the increasing of car , and fewer cars in the future can be expected .
(TUR,medium) It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than knowing facts . People should not only keep articles or dates from a textbook in their mind . Dates where great wars where held or milestone where set are easily available in todays world wich is full with informations . For example , only the knowing of the outbreak of the Second World War , 1 September 1939 is an information anyone can get from any history book . But the reasons for the start of the war , the circumstances how the Nationalist came to govern the country and the reality that the reasons for the Second War are the obligations from the winning countries to the defeated countriesat at the end of the First World War requires students to understand the reasons , relations and connections of the main ideas of any topic . Another example is the manufactoring of car . A student may find out easily the number of cars producted during a decade or the increase in the car production during the last 50 years , but the new live style wich has the mass production of cars brought with it , the effects on the society and the possibility to travel need more than learning statistics . There can be many examples given . Nowadays a student a can get many facts from libaries or the internet . So therefore i can say that not knowing facts , but understanding ideas , concepts , the relations between cause and effect are more important to learn .
(FRE,high) In our society , young people tend not to spend a lot of time helping their communities , and that is due to the society in which we live . Indeed , we observe at the moment a sort of individualism , which is expressed by the fact that people tend to live by themselves without taking care of their neighbours , acting like sheeps . Young people used to care for other people , but that was what the society told them to do . Nowadays , the matter is not that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , it is just that they do not have time to do so since our society is based on work and money . How could it be possible for young people to care for communities when they have barely time to take care of themselves . It is true that more and more young people live their lives according to their personal needs , which is kind of hypocrite in a way , but one has to admit that our society does not help young people very much . On one hand , studying is becoming more and more expensive . If you are courageous enough to make your dreams come true , you can try to find a job in order to finance your studies , but this does not seem normal . On the other hand , you have some countries where studies are paid by the government , as it is the case in Denmark for instance . In Scandinavia , one can notice that people and especially young people care for others , take part into helping communities . In brief , they are deeply involved in their society , willing to help in order to make things go better . In a nutshell , I would say that the young people 's investment in their communities is closely related to the society they live in . If young people have to bear adults ' role in life when they are not adults yet , I do not see how possible it is for them to get involved in their communities .
(HIN,high) I am in complete agreement with the point of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . I feel that is is better to have some knowledge of all the subjects than to have a lot of knowledge in one specific subject only . Tommorow , if some one appraoches me and asks some question which is related to some very bizzare topic , I may not able to give him or her the exact explanation . However , I am sure I will be very happy and satisfied with the fact that I will be able to atleast give him or her some basic information about the topic and get the work started . I think this point of atleast providing some basic info and guiding the start of the topic is far more better than completely being blank about the topic as the topic may not fall under your subject . We have all heard about the popular proverb `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' . I prefer to be the Jack and not the Master . Sometimes it is the demand of the situation or the job profile of the person . You never know what will your own kid ask you when he or she sees something for the first time . Not only in terms of family and educating your near and dear ones but also in a competitive atmosphere at work if one shows his abilities and knowledge in a humble way , he or she is bound to be appreciated and promoted . The best example can be the competitive examinations in India which are conducted to fill up government posts . These jobs are so demanding that they cover almost each and every subject from the scratch to right till the graduate level . That again tells us how demanding the job must be because you never know in which department or discipline you will be posted . So it is always preferable and expected of you to have a prior and basic knowledge of all the major subjects that will be put in practice . So basically I feel that if one is asked to talk on a bizzare topic or an unknown topic then he or she should be able to talk about atleast some basic points than just going blank . It is nothing wrong in not having any idea of an unknown topic but it is always at your advantage to know different subjects . You never know when and where will you need the information . And then you will be thanked not only by other peole but also by your ownself . I dont think there is any better definition to the word `` self satisfaction '' than this .
(KOR,medium) Older people enjoy life more than younger people do . From my perspective , the world is made for older people , instead of younger . When you are young you get ignored for what ever you do by olders . Also , the world is created because olders made lots of efford to develop the world . When you are older you can experience whatever you like , you can have freedom , and you have power to control youngers . When you are older you can experience what ever you love . You can drink alchol , you can go to anywhere you like , and you can choose what to do for the career . When you are young you are ruled by parents that they only want good , model stuents . They want you to do well in studies , sports and anything . I myself had difficult life when I was young , I was kind of stuck with my parents that , I could n't do whatever I like . When you are older you can have freedom . For as long as you like , you can go the wherever countries you like . If I turn thirty , I want to go around the world and explore different cultures . When you are young your parents want to be with you all the time . They do n't want you to go anywhere but the house . Thats what older people can enjoy life more than younger people do . When you are older you have power to control over young people . Say , you are police you have power to rule over young people , and teachers can do it too . Young people are just the step to be olders . That 's why young people can not enjoy life . They are limited to enjoy life . In other hand olders have so much time and energy to enjoy life . Also the vision is different , between young people and older people . Older people have much more wider views than young people . That 's how older people can enjoy their life . These are the reasons why older people are better than young people . Older people can experience , have freedon , and have power . World is like the world to older people not for the young people . If young people want to explore better life , they should study hard and may have patience to be older people . Older people enjoy life more than young people do .
(ITA,low) The fist cars start circulate during the first worl war , but this cars were just for rich people . After the second warld war , people feel better and had the possibility to had a job and improve their standard of life . CArs factory understand that the car will be the symbol of wellness of the maa society , and start to project cheap and smart cars that a normal familt could bought . Since this years , cars develope in their structure , in design , in confort , and the in number ! Today a family composed by four people has two cars , one for each parents . In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for dirrerent reasons . For example , when one of the sons can drive a car , usually use one of his parents 's car , but sometimes boys that can buy a car just for themselves . This is a big problem for the health of the world . Today we can see the big metropolis in the world . There is too much traffic of cars ! In this enormous cities people ca n't walk in the street , there is too much smog in the air and they ca n't breathe . Traffic is also very noisy , this is the main cause of acustic pollution . Our cities are growing up very queekly and the situation that we can see today in the big cities will be also in the small cities and in the country . Car factory try to design new motors and new cars to control the air and the acustic pollutions that cars caused , but if the number of the cars will grow up , this not solve the problem . I think that every people in the world have to be something about this and can do something to stop this diredtion . I have the possibility to buy a new car but I will use my mother 's car until I will need my own cars . Every one can use public transport and governement have to do something to increment people to use it
(SPA,medium) I have to say before entering this topic that we can not know what will happen in twenty years or even if cars will circulate around . But , if everything continious to progress as it has been doing for the last ten years I think that hopefully , there will be lots of cars but not as much as today . The reasons are that globalization is making us move around the globe more than ever before but also more quickly . Another task to have in mind is that cities are expanding , and this makes it impossible for cars to succesfully attend the requirments of people in terms of transport . So , if we have to cover longer distances in a shorter period of time i think it will only be possible if public transports become more accesible to people , more confortable and , of course , more efficient . Also for longer distances , air transport but speacially trains will bring the solution to the problem . Trains are more confortable in terms of working experience ( for example with a laptop ) , reading , having meetings or conversations , than in planes where taking off and landing do not permit nearly anythything . Of course between places where there is sea or ocean in between planes are the only option , and i also think that they will continue to imprive in many aspects . But returning to the city ( where by the way i have more experience ) , the rush hours are a complete waste of time . Governments and private institutions need to promote public transports or for example taxi cabs . This transports have two main benefits . The first one is that people in charge of driving are not in a hurry so the will drive more carefully . Also they will know the better way to follow and will transport more people in less space ( what does not necessary mean that you can not breath ) . The best example would be the metro ( or underground ) . Cities like Paris or NY need to invest in their metro services ( witch are old and smell really bad ) , but others like Madrid have invested a lot in it and , not in twenty years but now , today , there are less cars than before . Also cities where motorbikes and bikes are promoted experience a big fall in the number of cars .
