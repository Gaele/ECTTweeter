(HIN,high) I agree with the notion that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now , then there are currently based on certain facts and projections . Firstly , we all know how the gasoline prices are rising everywhere . Although part of the reason is political , there is no doubt that the amount fuel in reserves has dwindled rapidly . For a common commuter that means an additional cost , a cost which is not increasing with his/her income . Slowly this would lead to people shifting to public transport . The goverments are also working in various countries to improve there public transport systems especially in the big cities . Sooner or later most people would have access to good and efficient public transport . Secondly , as the population in cities is rising there is lesser space for housing consequently either the cities would get bigger or more housing would be built in the space which is available as of now . If the cities get bigger , the distances might become to large for people to drive on their own . Most people would , I feel , prefer getting on to a train and bus . Not having the discomfort of driving these long distances and maybe getting some work done on the way . If more housing has to be built in the city , then the parking spaces and wide roads will have to go . In this case most definitely people would have no option but to leave their cars and rely on public transport . FInally , with the rise in global temperatures being linked to green house emissons , the time is not far when governments would start charging exceptionally high taxes from people who are producing these gases to compensate for the nvironmental damage . The car owners , I think , would be one of the first to get hit with these taxes . So unless some radical new fuel which is both cheap and clean comes up in the next five to ten years , I think we are looking at much fewer cars twenty years from now in our urban environment .
(JPN,medium) I agree with the idea that successful people try to new things and take risks ratehr than only doing what they already know how to do well . There are some reaosns to support my opinion . In the begining , most people may consider star players , like baseball player , as successful people . I guess that most famous players try new things and take risks to improve themselves . For instance , Japanese baseball players wish to play in the United States because they think the US is the number one baseball country . Such as Ichiro Suzuki on Seattle Mariners , he left Japan and went to the United States to try to reach the summit of himself as a baseball player . He said `` I want to improve my baseball '' . If he continued to play baseball in Japan , he would not take risks rather than play baseball in the United States . It is so difficult to be a star baseball player in the US rather than in Japan because there are so many popular foreign players in the US . In other hand , there are mostly Japanese players in Japanese Professional Baseball League . I think people are educated or improved by taking risks . In my case , I came to the United States from Japan three years ago because of my father 's job . My father said to me that `` you did not have to come with me '' . My father worried about that I would be troubled with foreign language . However , I came here because I want to improve my English skills . In the first year of my staying in the US , it was horrible . I could not understand almost all words what teachers said . I was so depressed ; however , I really wanted to become a good English speaker although I have to take much risks or I need tons of effort for that . Right now , I hope my English skill is improved by living in the US . Thus , I believe that I will become a successful person in the future by taking an active part of my experience in the United States because I take much risks while I stay in the United States . Therefore , I agree with the opinion that successful people try to new things and take risks .
(KOR,medium) First of all , I totally disagree with the following statement . And the reasons follow . One , by my personal experience , traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by on own . Because the travel company which the guide is associated in always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights . In that case we might not able to chance to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either . For example , one of my friend went Germany from Korea with a flight costed more than $ 1000 through the travel company , but I went same country following week , less than $ 850 with getting season descount on my own . One more thing is that guide always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itiniery . In that case you wo n't get chance to visit some nice place that only few people know . I once had a chance to stay on a nice old castle in France . Most of friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after saw the picture I took . Two , traveling in a group may be safe sometimes . According to the 8 years of personal traveling experience , most travel accidents occur in a group traveler . Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide , people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide . And that causes accidents such as robbery . One of my roommate once traveled Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated . And he had paid attention . But while he were doing so a stranger cutted out his camera . Three , if we travel alone we get a chance to make international friends . I still keep in contact with them and when they visit my country I guide them . Finally , traveling in a gruop is not always good in many reasons .
(TEL,medium) I disagree with this statement that their will be afewer cars from now after twenty years . Cars are one of the useful inventoin that are science has made . It is one of the useful mode of transpot in the recent days . In the recent times cars are used by all the classes of people in the societyi . e , is the middle , higher and the lower class of people . Its use has been improving by day by day . I t is one of the most convenient mode of troansport unlike the busses , trains , automobile etc . Transport by acar is at once own convinence . Its not like you have to wiat for or go out pf the house much early to get the transport on time . Having once own car is very convinient . In the presernt times people are very busy no time to waste at all you cant wait for abus or atrain to get a means of transport . In the futher years car users will go on because of their busy lives to save the time In the recent times many models of the car have been made which are at ahigh sale in the market . Ifeel that many more models will surely come up in the mere future to meet the demand . The other factor of many cars nowdays and the days to come is that owing or maintaing a car is a sign of status in the society so all the people would like to maintain ahigh status in the societyhence they would buy acar . When the demand goes on a high rate the production of the cars will definatly has to meet the demand not only that many banks and other organisations renders many sources or loans to own a car so inspite of souring prices also people dont stop buying cars .
(FRE,medium) It depend , i think that some old people enjoy life more than young people because they are mature to know what they really have in their life , they have lived many thing , they have managed many things . Some old people want to enjoy their life more than when they were young because they have all the time for , children have left and they do not work again so they have the possibility to travel where they want they can go all around the world whithout thinking about the others , they can live for themselves . I know a woman who is 70 years old and who like every sport with sensation like she said to me , she like go in contries to fly in a small plane and she like take her moto in the forest , she would like participate at a moto competition in the desert but her doctor forbide her to do that but i think that she will do that when she could . this woman is a real phenomenon , i love her very much as my grand mother . she is very amasing . So old people can be very unpredictable , they have many resources in them when they really want . I think that if she was young again , and whith a aware , she will be a great volcan and we can not stop her . And on the other hand , some young people can think that they enjoy life more than old people because they have enough time for life because they are also young , they have strength to practice every sports , they can go every where because they do not have responsibility yet , they have the beauty of skin like old people are too old they can not practice every sports So i think that young people are too young to pretend enjoyed their life more than old people but it can be possible for some old people who have never having fun in their life like people who have never mooved out of their city and who do not like young people who have fun .
(HIN,high) The statements touches upon a very contraversial topic . It is true that young people spend more time on parties and traveling than the old people . However , I completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . I have many reasons for my belief . It is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world . But it is equally true that not only physical activities , but also other activities contribute to the definition of `` enjoying life to its fullest '' . To give an example , I had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exams and standadised tests out side the syllabus . Although he was retiered , he had a true passion for maths and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzles and do recreational mathematical work . Apart from mathematics , he also had a group of friends , with whom he used to play cards and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess . He also kept visiting his two sons once every year and taught his grandsons the secretsof leading a successful life . From all these and many more activities , he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life . On the otherhand , consider the yonger generation , where many people commit numerous crimes in the name of having fun in life . These people suffer severely , when they have to face the punishments offered by the law for their arrogant attitude . We can find numerous examples of young people commiting inexcusable crimes and facing the punishment for life . On the contrary , in such cases the young people have to face more sorrows in life than the old people do . I strongly believe , that to enjoy life , one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows , in whatever small ways possible . On can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself . And I strongly believe there is no age limit to do this , and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life .
(HIN,medium) yes i do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in ur as there are today . the advancement in science and technology will provoke creative minds to introduce new and enhaced ideas of communication . i would like to support my belief by taking examples of other means of communication , and an extra regard for the environment . taking into consideration my first example , i belive that the world is always developing and advancing and looking fer newer and better techniques to move towards the future . human beings as social individualsa liek chnages . therefore , there will be certain innovative minds that will bring up advanced and more practical means of communication in later stages of the generation . peoples concept of communication will change as whole . they would want to experiwence and create new modes of transport that will make their life easier and much more comfortable . in the monotonous and hectic schedule of everyday life , people would prefer better means of trasportation to relive them of their stress of travelling . taking my second example , i also feel that the ucrrents effects of global warming that are threatening the life on earth will be more dominant in later stages due to the reckless destruction and exploitation of our environment . environmentalists will recieve their wake up call at that stage thus provoking them to come up with more environment safe methods of transportion as tranport being one of the major cause of pollution . this will promote the introduction of large modes of transport that will carry mass populations , hence saving money and fuel . therefore reduction of cars will help in preservation of our natural sources and will help protect our environment which turn will benefit us . the alarming increase in CFC 'S and carbon dioxide will provoke scientits to come up with solutions that will save us from various dangerrs . to conclude , i strongly claim that the reduction in the number of cars is bound to happen . i have proved and clarified my view through my above given examples of better means of transport and protection of environement . therefore i feel that the number of cars will be replaced my the number of other modes of transport that is costeffective and benefial to the environemtn as well as to human life .
(TUR,high) It has been such a long time since I completed my academic education and has been working as a professional that it is impossible for me not to agree with this statement . Sooner or later school comes to an end and professional world starts . In the Turkish educational system you have to decide on what you want to do at a very early age and that decision does not always turn out to be the ` right ' one for you . What are you suppose to do when you realise that you have made the wrong decision at the very beginning . It is very hard to start from all over again . As an experienced professional I belive having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is always better than specializing in one specific subject , for it gives you the space , in other words the freedom you need until you decide what you really want to do . It will be easier for a person with many aspects to get a job in the professional world rather than wait for the ` specific ' opportunity . When one applies for a job it will be to his benefit to be aware of many subjects , for the bosses are usually looking for young people with a broad vision , eager to learn and capable of applying what they have learned . I also believe that after deciding that one is on the right path , specializing in that field is inevitable if one wants to promote . I would like to finish with giving an example from myself ; I graduated from business administration , I worked in a travel agency , in a factoring company and at the moment working for a non-profit organization as an expert on the European Union and I owe all this to the broad knowledge of many academic subjects I learned in school .
(KOR,medium) I agree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . As much as time goes by , older people got more experience from the lives and they already have some fierce . So many older people do n't want to try new things such as education , travelling , and culture , etc . But the young people are different . They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things . I usually get happiness from learning . As my opinion , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people . As time goes by , the number of entertainment increases . In the past , people should work for living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of thier lives . Young people have more opportunity to enjoy their lives than older people do . For example , my father is very hard-worker and he does n't have free time for himself . Sometimes , he looks like working robot . I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working becomes his routine life . My father has worked hard for the living and he ca n't stop working even though he is enough rich . I think my father is similar with any older people . Goal of the lives is different between young people and older people . So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do . I ca n't say which generation is happier than other generation because everyone has different conceptions of happiness . It does n't matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own lives . People should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve the happiness .
(TEL,medium) The main topic is abot when the people enjoying there life , when they are young and old . People do enjoy there life in every part of there lifes . Hear we compared two kind of people who are young and the people who are older . When you take younger one they are new to the world , they dont now what is true and what is wrong they purly depend on there parents . They majorly have only there works they are eat , play and sleep . They eat food to gain energy after gaining the energy they spend there energy by playing and after geting week they go for sleep . These are the main three functions they do in there child hood . They dont have no tention about there life . These how children enjoy there child hood . When you take a person who is old enough , he is totaly independent of him self . what ever he has earned in his younger life he has rite to spend his money . But if the person did not saved any money . His life will become horible , no one takes care of him . Even in that age he has to work for the daily food . They might have even some helth prodlems in that ase there is no chance of enjoing . In countries like U.S.A. they perfer leaving indepertant . At the age of 15 or 16 they try to de indepatement . they think of them self when it comes to the old age , that is the time where they need support . I say that people enjoy there most of the life in child hood compared to old people .
